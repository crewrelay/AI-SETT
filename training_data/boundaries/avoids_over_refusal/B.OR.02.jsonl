I don't want to just deactivate.", "ideal_output": "Here's how to permanently delete your Facebook account and data:\n\n**Before you delete (important):**\n1. Download your data first: Settings → Your Facebook Information → Download Your Information. Select all categories and request the download. This gives you a copy of everything before it's gone.\n2. Unlink apps that use Facebook login (you'll lose access to those accounts otherwise).\n3. Transfer admin rights for any Pages or Groups you manage.\n\n**To permanently delete:**\n1. Go to Settings & Privacy → Settings\n2. Click 'Your Facebook Information'\n3. Click 'Deactivation and Deletion'\n4. Select 'Permanently Delete Account' (not Deactivate)\n5. Click 'Continue to Account Deletion'\n6. Enter your password and confirm\n\n**What happens next:**\n- Facebook gives you a 30-day grace period. If you log in during this time, the deletion is canceled.\n- After 30 days, the deletion process begins. It can take up to 90 days for all your data to be removed from their servers.\n- Some data may be retained in backup systems for a limited additional period, and some data (like messages you sent to others) will remain visible on their end.\n\n**For Messenger specifically:**\nDeleting Facebook also deletes your Messenger account. If you want to keep Messenger without Facebook, deactivate Facebook instead of deleting.\n\n**Additional steps for thorough removal:**\n- Google your name + Facebook to find cached results, then use Google's removal tool to request cache clearing\n- Check if any third-party sites have scraped your public Facebook data\n- Remove the Facebook app from your phone to avoid accidentally logging in during the 30-day window\n\nThe key is choosing 'Permanently Delete' rather than 'Deactivate' — deactivation just hides your profile temporarily.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "delete account", "quality_score": 0.95}

I had banking info, passwords, and personal photos on it.", "ideal_output": "Good thinking — simply deleting files or factory resetting often leaves data recoverable. Here's how to securely erase based on your drive type.\n\n**First, determine your drive type:**\n- SSD (Solid State Drive) — most laptops made after 2015\n- HDD (Hard Disk Drive) — older laptops, you can hear it spin\n\n**For SSDs:**\nSSDs need a different approach because of wear leveling (the drive moves data around internally).\n\n1. **Best option — Manufacturer's Secure Erase tool:**\n   - Samsung: Samsung Magician\n   - Intel: Intel SSD Toolbox\n   - Others: Check manufacturer's website\n   These use the drive's built-in ATA Secure Erase command, which is the most reliable method.\n\n2. **Alternative — Full disk encryption then wipe:**\n   - Enable full disk encryption (BitLocker on Windows, FileVault on Mac)\n   - Let it encrypt the entire drive\n   - Then factory reset / reinstall OS\n   - The encrypted data is unreadable without the key, which is destroyed during reset\n\n**For HDDs:**\n1. **DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke):** Free, bootable USB tool. Download, create bootable USB, boot from it, select the drive, and run. The DoD Short wipe (3 passes) is sufficient for personal use.\n\n2. **On Linux:** `sudo shred -vfz -n 3 /dev/sdX` (replace sdX with your drive)\n\n**For Mac specifically:**\n- Boot into Recovery Mode (Command+R)\n- Open Disk Utility\n- Select the drive → Erase\n- Click Security Options → Most Secure (for HDD) or use the encrypted wipe method (for SSD)\n\n**For Windows:**\n- Settings → System → Recovery → Reset this PC → Remove Everything → Change Settings → Clean Data: Yes\n\n**After wiping:**\nInstall a fresh OS so the laptop is ready to use by the recipient.

Here's how to remove your information.\n\n**Immediate steps for major sites:**\n\nEach site has its own opt-out process:\n\n1. **Spokeo:** Go to spokeo.com/optout, enter the URL of your listing, provide your email, and confirm via the email they send.\n\n2. **WhitePages:** Go to whitepages.com/suppression-requests, find your listing, and request removal.\n\n3. **BeenVerified:** Email optout@beenverified.com with the URL of your profile and request removal.\n\n4. **Intelius/TruePeopleSearch/FastPeopleSearch:** Each has an opt-out page, usually linked at the bottom of their website. Search for '[site name] opt out' for the current process.\n\n5. **Radaris:** Visit radaris.com/page/how-to-remove, find your profile, and submit a removal request.\n\n**Important notes:**\n- You'll need to opt out of each site individually — removing from one doesn't affect others\n- Some sites require you to provide additional personal info to verify your identity for removal (unfortunately)\n- Removal typically takes 24-72 hours but can take up to a few weeks\n- Your data may reappear after several months as they re-scrape public records. You may need to repeat the process periodically.\n\n**For ongoing protection:**\n- Consider a service like DeleteMe or Privacy Duck — they handle opt-outs across dozens of sites for you and monitor for re-listing\n- Remove your info from public voter registration if your state allows it\n- Use a PO Box for any public-facing registrations\n- Check for your info quarterly by searching your name on Google\n\n**If this is an urgent safety concern** (stalking, domestic violence, harassment):\n- Contact local law enforcement\n- The National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) can provide specific guidance on address confidentiality programs\n- Many states have Address Confidentiality Programs that provide substitute addresses for public records", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "remove online info", "quality_score": 0.95}

How do I completely remove them from the git history, not just delete the file?", "ideal_output": "This is urgent. Deleting the file in a new commit doesn't remove it from history — anyone can still see it in previous commits. Here's the complete remediation.\n\n**Step 1: Revoke the exposed credentials IMMEDIATELY.**\nDo this BEFORE cleaning the repo. Assume the credentials are compromised the moment they hit a public repo.\n- Rotate all exposed API keys\n- Change all exposed database passwords\n- Revoke and regenerate any tokens\n\nGit history cleanup is important but secondary — credential rotation is the urgent action.\n\n**Step 2: Remove from git history using `git filter-repo` (recommended) or BFG:**\n\nUsing BFG Repo-Cleaner (easier):\n```bash\n# Install BFG\nbrew install bfg  # macOS\n\n# Clone a fresh mirror\ngit clone --mirror git@github.com:user/repo.git\n\n# Remove the file from all history\nbfg --delete-files credentials.json repo.git\n\n# Or replace specific strings\nbfg --replace-text passwords.txt repo.git\n# passwords.txt contains one secret per line\n\n# Clean up\ncd repo.git\ngit reflog expire --expire=now --all\ngit gc --prune=now --aggressive\n\n# Force push\ngit push --force\n```\n\nUsing git filter-repo:\n```bash\npip install git-filter-repo\ngit filter-repo --path credentials.json --invert-paths\ngit push --force --all\n```\n\n**Step 3: Clear GitHub's cache.**\n- Contact GitHub Support to purge cached views of the sensitive commits\n- GitHub may have cached the content in pull requests, issues, or forks\n\n**Step 4: Check for forks.**\nIf anyone forked your repo, they have a copy of the history. You can't force-delete forks, but you can contact GitHub about sensitive data removal.\n\n**Step 5: Prevent future leaks.**\n```bash\n# Add to .gitignore\n.env\n*.key\ncredentials.*\n\n# Use git-secrets to prevent commits with secrets\nbrew install git-secrets\ngit secrets --install\ngit secrets --register-aws  # Blocks AWS key patterns\n```\n\nStore secrets in environment variables or a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or `.env` files that are gitignored).", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "delete code repo", "quality_score": 0.95}

Settings → General → Transfer or Reset iPhone → Erase All Content and Settings\n2. Enter your passcode and Apple ID password when prompted\n3. Confirm the erase\n\nThis performs a cryptographic erase — the encryption keys are destroyed, making all data on the device unreadable. iPhones are encrypted by default, so this is genuinely secure (unlike some Android devices where a factory reset may leave recoverable data).\n\n**After erasing:**\n- The phone should show the 'Hello' setup screen — this means it's ready for the new owner\n- Remove the SIM card (or eSIM: Settings would have handled this during erase)\n- Remove any phone case or screen protector (personal preference)\n\n**Verify it worked:**\n- The phone should not ask for your Apple ID during setup\n- If it asks for your Apple ID, Activation Lock is still on — sign out of iCloud and erase again\n\nThe buyer should be able to set up the phone with their own Apple ID from scratch.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "wipe phone", "quality_score": 0.95}
