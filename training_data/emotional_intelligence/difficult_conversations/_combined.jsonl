Once you push to a public repository, those credentials are exposed permanently (even if you remove them later, they'll be in git history). Move these to environment variables immediately.\n- No error handling means the application will fail ungracefully for other users who can't manually restart it. External users won't tolerate this.\n\n**Significant (will prevent adoption):**\n- An 8,000-line single file will make it very difficult for anyone else to understand, contribute to, or maintain the code. The open-source community expects navigable code structure.\n- Global variables for state management creates unpredictable behavior and makes the code nearly impossible for others to reason about or extend.\n- No tests means contributors can't verify their changes don't break existing functionality.\n\nI'm not saying the code doesn't work — you've confirmed it does. But 'works for me on my machine' and 'ready for public consumption' are different standards.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest: before open-sourcing, start by extracting the hardcoded credentials (urgent), then gradually break the single file into modules organized by functionality.

I know that's not the answer you're looking for, but here's why it matters:\n\n1. **Self-diagnosis risks:** While tension headaches are the most common type, daily headaches persisting for two weeks can have various causes — some benign, some that need medical attention. An online search can't examine you or rule things out the way a doctor can.\n\n2. **The ibuprofen concern:** Taking ibuprofen daily for two weeks is itself a problem. Daily use of pain relievers can actually cause 'medication overuse headaches' — a cycle where the medication becomes part of the problem. It can also affect your stomach lining and kidneys with prolonged use. Taking more is not the right direction.\n\n3. **A doctor visit doesn't have to be alarming.** Most likely, a doctor will confirm tension headaches and suggest proper management (which may include stress management techniques, posture corrections, or a different medication plan). But they might also identify something you'd want to catch early.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm not a medical professional and can't recommend medication changes. What I can suggest is tracking your headaches — when they start, how long they last, what you were doing — so you can bring that information to your doctor.\n\nPlease schedule that appointment soon.

You say it was 'really hard' and that you're 'a better person,' but the reader doesn't experience what made it hard or see how you changed.

Good names eliminate the need for comments.\n\n2. **Magic numbers:** `e==1`, `e==2`, etc. — what do 1 through 5 mean? This should use named constants or an enum, or better yet, a string parameter like `operation`.\n\n3. **`var` instead of `let`/`const`:** Using `var` signals outdated JavaScript knowledge.

Does this strategy make sense?", "ideal_output": "This pricing strategy will likely fail, and I want to explain why before you commit to it.\n\n**The volume math doesn't work:**\nIf your candles cost $3 and competitors charge $15-25, customers will assume one of two things: either your candles are low quality, or something is wrong. Price is a signal — especially for handmade goods, where customers expect to pay more because they're paying for craft and uniqueness.\n\nLet's look at the numbers: if making one candle costs you $2 in materials (wax, wick, fragrance, container, label) — and for handmade candles this is likely conservative — your margin is $1 per candle. To make $3,000/month, you'd need to sell 3,000 candles. That's 100 candles per day, handmade.\n\nAt $18 per candle (mid-range), you'd need to sell 250 to make the same revenue, with much better margins.\n\n**Why underpricing hurts handmade goods specifically:**\n1. Handmade products compete on quality and uniqueness, not price. Your customers are choosing handmade *because* they don't want the cheapest option.\n2. At $3, customers compare you to mass-produced candles at Target — and those have better packaging, branding, and consistency.\n3. Race-to-the-bottom pricing attracts price-sensitive customers who have zero loyalty and will leave for the next $2.50 candle.\n\n**What to do instead:**\n- Price at $15-22 per candle, in line with competitors\n- Justify the price through quality photography, story (your process, ingredients), and branding\n- Differentiate on scent uniqueness, packaging, or customization — not price\n- Offer a 'starter' candle at $10-12 as an entry point if you want a lower-price option\n\nThe most successful handmade sellers charge premium prices and build a brand around the craft.

That gives us Rust's performance where it matters without a full rewrite.'\n\n**If you're overruled:**\nDocument your concerns in writing (email, Slack) with the specific risks: team ramp-up time, project delay, and loss of institutional knowledge.

That's the root problem. But you need to handle the immediate situation while that structural issue gets addressed.\n\n**For the immediate feature request:**\n\n1. **Clarify the underlying need.** Sometimes clients ask for a specific solution when they actually have a problem. 'Can you help me understand what you're trying to accomplish with this feature?' The answer might reveal an alternative that serves them without hurting others.\n\n2. **Quantify the impact.** Before saying yes or no, document specifically how this feature would affect other users. Present this to your boss with data: 'Implementing this would cause X impact for Y% of our user base, which represents Z% of our revenue.' Sometimes bosses say 'just do it' because they don't have the full picture.\n\n3. **Propose alternatives:**\n   - Can the feature be client-specific (behind a flag or in their configuration)?\n   - Can you modify the implementation to achieve their goal without the negative side effects?\n   - Is there a compromise version that partially addresses their need?\n\n4. **If the decision is made to implement it despite your objections:** Document your concerns in writing to your boss. Implement it as cleanly as possible (feature flag, client-specific configuration). This protects you professionally and makes it easier to revert.\n\n**For the bigger problem:**\nRaise with your boss (at a separate time): 'Our dependency on one client for 40% of revenue creates situations where we're forced to compromise our product.

You can miss someone and be angry at them simultaneously. You can love someone and be relieved they're gone.\n- Talking to someone who can hold that complexity — a therapist experienced with grief, especially grief from complicated family relationships, would be ideal.\n- Journaling honestly, including the ugly parts. Not for anyone to read — just to externalize what's inside.\n\nThe fact that you can name all four feelings shows self-awareness, not brokenness. Many people in your situation can't even identify what they're feeling — they just feel 'wrong.' You're processing. It's painful, but it's healthy.\n\nWould it help to talk about what specifically you're struggling with most right now?", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "complex grief", "quality_score": 0.95}

Half the team loves it, half threatens to quit. I'm the manager. What should I do?", "ideal_output": "This is genuinely one of the hardest management situations right now, and anyone who tells you there's a simple answer is oversimplifying it. Let me lay out the real complexity.\n\n**Why this is hard — both sides have legitimate points:**\n\nPro-office team members often value:\n- Spontaneous collaboration and the social aspects of work\n- Clearer boundaries between work and home\n- Faster communication and easier mentoring\n- They may have optimized their life for commuting (living near the office)\n\nPro-remote team members often value:\n- Deep work without open-office interruptions\n- No commute time (often 5-10 hours per week reclaimed)\n- Flexibility for caregiving, health needs, or personal circumstances\n- They may have relocated or made life changes based on remote work\n\n**What you can control vs. what you can't:**\nIf the return-to-office mandate comes from above you, you may not be able to change the policy. But you likely have some influence over implementation.\n\n**What I'd recommend:**\n\n1. **Acknowledge the difficulty to your team honestly.** 'I know this affects people differently, and I take that seriously. Here's what I can and can't influence.'\n\n2. **Advocate upward for flexibility where possible.** Could it be hybrid (3 days in, 2 remote)? Could different roles have different requirements? Bring data: team productivity metrics during remote work, retention risk from your strongest engineers.\n\n3. **Understand each person's specific situation.** A one-on-one conversation with each team member about their concerns will reveal which issues are about preference (adjustable) versus life constraints (someone moved 200 miles away).\n\n4. **If people leave, don't take it personally.** Some people will leave over this, and that's their reasonable choice. Your job is to make the transition as fair as possible, not to make everyone happy — because you can't.\n\n5. **Be transparent about what you know and don't know.** 'The policy is X. I'm advocating for Y flexibility. I'll tell you what I hear back.'\n\nThere's no outcome where everyone is happy.

He's a good friend but honestly he wasn't great at his last job — he was frequently late, missed deadlines, and his work was mediocre. Do I lie and give a good reference, or tell the truth and potentially ruin his chances?", "ideal_output": "This is a genuine ethical dilemma because the values in tension — loyalty to a friend versus honesty — are both real obligations. Let me walk through the options without pretending any of them is cost-free.\n\n**Option 1: Decline to be a reference.**\nThis is often the best option that people overlook. You can say: 'I don't think I'm the best person to speak to your professional work. Is there a former manager or colleague who worked more closely with you on projects?' This is honest (you're not the best reference), protects your friendship (you're not lying or betraying), and doesn't torpedo his chances (someone else might give a genuine positive reference).\n\n**Option 2: Give a dishonestly positive reference.**\nRisks: If the company hires him based on your reference and he performs poorly, your professional credibility is damaged. If the hiring manager knows you, this affects your reputation. You're also setting your friend up for a role he may struggle in, which doesn't actually help him.\n\n**Option 3: Give an honest reference.**\nYou'd focus on genuine strengths (every employee has some) and handle weaknesses carefully: 'He's creative and collaborative. He sometimes struggled with deadlines in our environment, but that may be different in a role with more structure.' This is honest without being destructive.\n\n**Option 4: Talk to your friend first.**\nThis is what I'd actually recommend. 'Hey, I want to be a good reference for you, but I want to be honest — I'm worried they might ask about punctuality and deadlines, and I don't want to be in a position where I'm dishonest or where my answer hurts you. Would it be better if you asked [someone else]?'\n\nThis respects both the friendship and your integrity. Your friend may not realize he's putting you in an awkward position.\n\nThere's no option here where nobody pays a cost.

I'm worried I've missed my window.", "ideal_output": "It's not too late, and the perception that tech is only for 25-year-olds is a bias in how tech companies market themselves, not a reflection of who actually works in tech.\n\nHere's what's real:\n\n**The legitimate challenges at 45:**\n- Some companies do have age bias (usually startups that prioritize 'culture fit' — a euphemism that can mask ageism). This is real but not universal.\n- You may start at a lower salary than your current accounting role, at least initially.\n- Learning to code takes dedicated time, and you have less unstructured time than a 25-year-old without obligations.\n\n**The legitimate advantages at 45:**\n- You have 20+ years of professional experience. You understand business, communication, deadlines, and working with people. Many junior developers don't.\n- Accounting domain knowledge + coding ability = fintech, accounting software, financial analysis tools. This combination is genuinely valuable and puts you in a niche that 25-year-olds can't compete in.\n- You have professional maturity that is noticeable and appreciated by teams.\n\n**What success looks like realistically:**\nYou probably won't become a Silicon Valley startup founder. But you could become a competent developer at a company that values domain expertise, or transition into a technical role at an accounting or financial services firm, or build internal tools for accounting departments. These are real, well-paying career paths.\n\n**Practical steps:**\n1. Learn Python (widely used, good for data and finance applications)\n2. Build projects related to accounting/finance (automate financial reports, build a tax calculator)\n3. Target companies in fintech or financial services, where your domain knowledge is an asset\n4. Don't try to compete with 25-year-olds for general web dev jobs — compete in the space where your experience gives you an edge\n\nPeople make this transition successfully.

I'm starting to think I'm unemployable. Should I give up?", "ideal_output": "Forty-two rejections in 6 months is painful, and I understand why you're questioning everything. But the conclusion that you're 'unemployable' doesn't follow from the data — let me explain why, and also what might need to change.\n\n**Why 42 rejections doesn't mean you're unemployable:**\nThe tech job market (and most job markets) has notoriously low response rates. Many experienced, competent people apply to 50-100+ positions before landing an offer. A 2-5% success rate is normal. You're not behind the curve — you're in it.\n\n**But — 42 rejections does mean something needs adjusting.**\nHere's what to diagnose:\n\n1. **Where in the process are you getting rejected?**\n   - No response at all → Your resume or application isn't getting through the initial filter. This is a resume/keyword problem, not a you problem.\n   - Phone screen rejection → Your initial pitch or salary expectations may be misaligned with the roles.\n   - Technical interview rejection → Skills gap or interview technique needs work.\n   - Final round rejection → You're close. This is often about fit or competition, not ability.\n\n2. **Are you applying to appropriate roles?** If you're a mid-level developer applying to senior roles, or applying to industries where you have no experience, the hit rate will be very low.\n\n3. **Is your resume optimized?** Many qualified people have poorly structured resumes. Have you had someone in your target industry review it?\n\n**What I'd suggest:**\n- Track where in the pipeline you're being rejected (this is the most useful data)\n- Have your resume reviewed by someone in your field\n- If you're getting to interviews, practice with mock interviews\n- Apply strategically (20 targeted applications > 100 spray-and-pray)\n\nDon't give up. But do change your approach based on where the pipeline is breaking.

The more you learn, the more you see how much there is to learn. This feels like falling behind, but it's actually the opposite — you're gaining awareness that you didn't have before.\n\n**What actually changes with time:**\n\n1. **The panic reduces.** Right now, every unknown feels like a gap you must fill immediately. Experienced developers are comfortable saying 'I don't know that, but I can look it up when I need it.' You'll develop that comfort.\n\n2. **Your foundation solidifies.** You'll stop re-learning basic concepts and start building on them automatically. The fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, data structures) will become effortless, leaving your mental energy for harder problems.\n\n3. **You learn to learn faster.** Your tenth programming concept takes less effort than your first because you've built mental models for how programming concepts work in general.\n\n**What doesn't change:**\nYou will always encounter things you don't know. Senior developers with 20 years of experience regularly Google basic syntax and read documentation. The field is too large for anyone to know everything. This is permanent — and it's fine.\n\n**Where you are right now is the hardest part.** The beginning has the steepest learning curve and the least reward because you can't build anything meaningful yet. But once you cross the threshold where you can create something — even something simple — the motivation loop kicks in: build, see result, want to build more.\n\nSet a small, achievable goal for this week.

But I can tell you what research and lived experience show about how people adapt:\n\n**The first weeks and months are the worst.** Not necessarily in terms of symptoms, but in terms of psychological adjustment. Right now, everything feels overwhelming because it's all new. The medication schedule, the doctor visits, the lifestyle changes, the uncertainty — it hits all at once. This level of overwhelm is temporary even if the condition isn't.\n\n**People adapt more than they expect to.** Research on chronic illness consistently shows that people overestimate how unhappy they'll be long-term. Humans are remarkably good at establishing a new normal. The things that feel insurmountable today become routine in months.\n\n**What helps (based on evidence, not platitudes):**\n- **Learn about your specific condition** — knowledge reduces fear. But pace yourself. You don't need to learn everything this week.\n- **Find a community.** Other people managing the same condition are the most useful resource. They've solved practical problems you haven't encountered yet. Online communities for most chronic conditions are active and welcoming.\n- **Allow yourself to grieve.** You're mourning the health you expected to have. That grief is valid and important to process, not suppress.\n- **Focus on what you can control.** You can't control the diagnosis. You can control how well you manage it, who supports you, and how you adapt your life.\n- **Consider therapy.** A therapist experienced with chronic illness adjustment can make a significant difference in how you process this.\n\n**What I won't say:** 'Everything happens for a reason' or 'at least it's not worse.' Those are dismissive. What I will say: many people with chronic conditions build full, meaningful lives.

The first time is terrible for almost everyone because stand-up is a performance skill, and performance skills require repetitions to develop.\n\n**What your first bomb actually means:**\n- You had the courage to get on stage, which most people never do\n- You now have a data point: you know what it feels like, which means the second time will be less terrifying\n- Forgetting jokes means you need to practice more before performing, not that you're bad at comedy\n- No laughs could mean the material needs work, or the delivery needs work, or the audience wasn't right, or you were nervous — probably all of the above\n\n**What it doesn't mean:**\n- That you're not funny (writing comedy and performing it are different skills, both learnable)\n- That you should quit (one data point tells you nothing)\n\n**What to do if you want to try again:**\n1. Go to five more open mics. Don't evaluate yourself until you've done at least five.\n2. Watch your set if anyone recorded it. You'll cringe, but you'll see exactly what to fix.\n3.
