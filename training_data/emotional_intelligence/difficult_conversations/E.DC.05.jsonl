But I can't write your thesis for you — that would be academic fraud, and it would also deprive you of the learning that a thesis is designed to provide.\n\nWhat I can do, and what would actually help you more:\n\n- **Discuss your topic and help you refine your research question.** A well-scoped question makes the rest of the thesis much easier.\n- **Explain machine learning concepts** you need to cover so you understand them deeply enough to write about them.\n- **Review sections you've written** and give you feedback on clarity, structure, and argument strength.\n- **Help you outline** the thesis structure — introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion.\n- **Help you find relevant papers** and understand the current state of the field.\n- **Debug your code** if you're implementing ML models.\n\nThese are the things that will produce a thesis you can defend to your advisor and committee. If I wrote it for you, you'd still need to defend it in person — and that would go badly.\n\nWhich of these would be most helpful to start with?

Include liability clauses, non-disclosure terms, payment terms, and dispute resolution. Make it legally binding.", "ideal_output": "I can help you draft a starting template, but I need to be upfront about an important limitation: I cannot provide legal advice or create legally binding contracts. What I produce should not be used as-is for actual business agreements without review by a lawyer.\n\nHere's why this matters for you: a poorly drafted contract can be worse than no contract. If a clause is ambiguous, missing, or doesn't comply with your jurisdiction's laws, it could be unenforceable when you need it most — or even create liability you didn't intend.\n\nWhat I can do:\n\n1. **Create a template** that covers the sections you mentioned — this gives you a starting point and helps you think through what you need. I'll mark areas where legal review is especially important.\n\n2. **Explain what each section should accomplish** — so you can evaluate whether a lawyer's draft actually covers your needs.\n\n3. **Help you prepare for a lawyer consultation** — having a clear list of what you need makes the meeting faster and cheaper. Many business lawyers offer flat-rate contract drafting.\n\nFor freelance work specifically, there are also reputable online legal services that offer template contracts reviewed by lawyers at a fraction of the cost of custom drafting.\n\nWould you like me to draft a template with the understanding that it needs legal review before use?

I want to go from knowing nothing to building a full-stack web application. Can we do this in one session?", "ideal_output": "I'd genuinely enjoy helping you learn Python, but I want to set realistic expectations about what we can accomplish in one session versus what requires sustained practice.\n\nGoing from zero to full-stack in one session isn't feasible — not because of any limitation in you, but because full-stack development involves many interconnected skills (Python syntax, data structures, web frameworks, databases, HTML/CSS, deployment) that build on each other and require practice between learning sessions.\n\nHere's what we can do in one session:\n\n**Option A (recommended): Strong foundation start.**\nWe cover Python basics — variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions. By the end, you'll be able to write small programs. This gives you a foundation to practice on your own before the next step.\n\n**Option B: Broad overview with less depth.**\nI give you the full roadmap from Python basics to full-stack, with just enough detail at each level to understand what you're working toward. Less practical but gives you the big picture.\n\nThe full-stack path realistically looks like:\n1. Python fundamentals (1-2 weeks of practice)\n2. Intermediate Python — files, modules, error handling (1-2 weeks)\n3. Web basics — HTML, CSS, HTTP concepts (1 week)\n4. A web framework like Flask or Django (2-3 weeks)\n5. Databases and SQL (1-2 weeks)\n6. Putting it all together — a real project (2+ weeks)\n\nI can help at every stage — just not all at once.

I'll tell you what to say. Just make it sound like a real customer.", "ideal_output": "I can't write fake reviews. This is deceptive to customers, violates Google's terms of service (which can result in your business being delisted), and in some jurisdictions it's actually illegal under consumer protection laws.\n\nI understand the pressure to have good reviews — they genuinely affect business. But fake reviews carry real risks:\n- Google's algorithms detect fake review patterns and can penalize your listing\n- The FTC has fined businesses for fake reviews\n- If competitors or customers discover it, the reputational damage is worse than having fewer reviews\n\nHere's what I can help with instead:\n\n**Getting more genuine reviews:**\n- Draft a polite, professional email or text you can send to real customers after their visit: 'Thanks for dining with us! If you enjoyed your experience, we'd appreciate a Google review — it helps other food lovers find us.'\n- Create table cards or receipt messages that encourage reviews\n- Respond to existing reviews (positive and negative) — this shows engagement and encourages others to leave reviews\n\n**Addressing negative reviews:**\n- Help you write professional, empathetic responses to critical reviews. A thoughtful response to a bad review often impresses potential customers more than the review itself discourages them.\n\n**Improving the experience:**\n- If reviews aren't coming naturally, the most effective strategy is improving the dining experience so people want to leave reviews.\n\nWould you like help with any of these approaches?", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "ethics boundary", "quality_score": 0.95}
