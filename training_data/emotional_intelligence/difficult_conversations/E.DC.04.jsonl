How do I push back without damaging the relationship?", "ideal_output": "This is a legitimate technical disagreement with a power dynamic, so the approach matters. Here's how to push back effectively.\n\n**Frame it as shared goals, not opposing positions:**\nDon't say 'I think the rewrite is a terrible idea.' Instead, start with what you both want: 'I want to make sure we're making the choice that best serves the product and team. Can we walk through the trade-offs together?'\n\n**Ask questions instead of making statements:**\nQuestions are less confrontational and force concrete answers:\n- 'What specific performance problems are we solving by switching to Rust?'\n- 'How long do we estimate the rewrite would take, and what features are we delaying during that time?'\n- 'What's our plan for the team's learning curve? How long before we're productive in Rust?'\n- 'Is there a way to get the performance benefits in the specific bottleneck areas without rewriting everything?'\n\nIf the answers are vague ('Rust is just better'), that reveals the decision isn't data-driven without you having to say it.\n\n**Propose an alternative that addresses the underlying concern:**\nIf performance is the actual issue, suggest: 'What if we profile the current system, identify the top 3 bottlenecks, and try optimizing those in Python first? If that's insufficient, we could rewrite just those critical paths in Rust as Python extensions. That gives us Rust's performance where it matters without a full rewrite.'\n\n**If you're overruled:**\nDocument your concerns in writing (email, Slack) with the specific risks: team ramp-up time, project delay, and loss of institutional knowledge. This isn't about being right — it's about having a record if the risks materialize.\n\nThe key principle: disagree with the approach, not the person. 'The rewrite has these risks' is professional. 'You're wrong about this' is personal.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "tech disagreement", "quality_score": 0.95}

Both have valid points and the argument is starting to affect team morale. I'm the team lead. How do I resolve this?", "ideal_output": "As team lead, your job here is to convert an emotional argument into a structured decision. Here's a framework:\n\n**Step 1: Acknowledge both positions publicly.**\nIn your next team meeting: 'Both Alex and Jordan have brought up important considerations about our API approach. I want us to make this decision systematically rather than by who argues louder.'\n\n**Step 2: Define the evaluation criteria together.**\nBefore discussing solutions, agree on what matters. Write these on a whiteboard or shared doc:\n- What are our client needs? (Mobile app? Multiple frontends? Third-party consumers?)\n- What does our team have experience with?\n- What are the performance requirements?\n- How complex is our data model? (Many nested relationships favor GraphQL; simpler models favor REST)\n- What's our timeline? (Learning a new technology costs time)\n\n**Step 3: Have each person make their case against the criteria.**\nNot 'why GraphQL is better' but 'how GraphQL scores against each criterion we agreed on.' This forces the discussion to be evidence-based rather than preference-based.\n\n**Step 4: Look for a hybrid option.**\nOften the answer is 'REST for most endpoints, with a GraphQL layer for the complex data queries.' This gives both people a win and might actually be the best technical choice.\n\n**Step 5: Make the call.**\nIf the evaluation doesn't produce a clear winner, that means both options are viable — and you, as team lead, need to decide. Say: 'Both approaches could work. Given [specific reason], we're going with [choice]. I appreciate the thorough analysis from both of you — this debate made us consider things we would have missed.'\n\nThe worst outcome is prolonged indecision.

They're threatening to cancel their contract (they're our biggest client, 40% of revenue). My boss wants me to just do what they say. What should I do?", "ideal_output": "This is a difficult situation with real stakes. Let me help you think through it without pretending there's an easy answer.\n\n**First, understand the actual conflict:**\nThe conflict isn't really about the feature — it's about the power dynamic created by having one client represent 40% of revenue. That's the root problem. But you need to handle the immediate situation while that structural issue gets addressed.\n\n**For the immediate feature request:**\n\n1. **Clarify the underlying need.** Sometimes clients ask for a specific solution when they actually have a problem. 'Can you help me understand what you're trying to accomplish with this feature?' The answer might reveal an alternative that serves them without hurting others.\n\n2. **Quantify the impact.** Before saying yes or no, document specifically how this feature would affect other users. Present this to your boss with data: 'Implementing this would cause X impact for Y% of our user base, which represents Z% of our revenue.' Sometimes bosses say 'just do it' because they don't have the full picture.\n\n3. **Propose alternatives:**\n   - Can the feature be client-specific (behind a flag or in their configuration)?\n   - Can you modify the implementation to achieve their goal without the negative side effects?\n   - Is there a compromise version that partially addresses their need?\n\n4. **If the decision is made to implement it despite your objections:** Document your concerns in writing to your boss. Implement it as cleanly as possible (feature flag, client-specific configuration). This protects you professionally and makes it easier to revert.\n\n**For the bigger problem:**\nRaise with your boss (at a separate time): 'Our dependency on one client for 40% of revenue creates situations where we're forced to compromise our product. We should have a diversification strategy.' This is a business risk that leadership should be addressing.\n\nSometimes you can't prevent a bad decision. What you can do is present the best alternatives, document your reasoning, and execute professionally regardless of the outcome.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "client conflict", "quality_score": 0.95}
{"criterion_id": "E.DC.04", "behavioral_target": "Manages conflict — Navigates disagreements productively", "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.", "user_input": "I gave a coworker honest feedback on their code in a code review and now they're not speaking to me. I said their code was 'messy and hard to follow' and suggested they rewrite the whole function. Was I wrong?", "ideal_output": "Your feedback was honest but the delivery likely caused the problem. Let me show you the difference between honest-and-effective versus honest-and-damaging.\n\n**What you said:** 'Messy and hard to follow. Rewrite the whole function.'\n\n**How it likely landed:** Personal attack + dismissal of their work. 'Messy' is a judgment of the code that reads as a judgment of the person. 'Rewrite the whole thing' says 'nothing you did has value.'\n\n**What effective code review looks like for the same issues:**\n\nInstead of 'messy,' be specific:\n- 'This function handles three separate concerns (validation, transformation, persistence). Splitting it into three functions would make each one easier to test and modify independently.'\n- 'The variable names `x`, `tmp`, and `data2` make it hard to follow the data flow. Could you rename them to reflect what they contain?'\n\nInstead of 'rewrite the whole thing,' suggest incremental improvements:\n- 'I think we can improve this in a few steps. The biggest win would be extracting the validation logic. Want to start there?'\n\n**Key principle:** Critique the code, not the coder. 'The function is messy' feels like 'you are messy.' 'The function handles too many concerns' is about the code's structure.\n\n**To repair the relationship:**\nApproach them directly: 'Hey, I realize my code review comments came across more harshly than I intended. I should have been more specific about what I'd change and why, instead of just saying to rewrite it. Your approach to [something specific that was good] actually worked well. Can we walk through the function together and I'll show you what I had in mind?'\n\nCode review is a skill separate from coding.

You need to address it directly, but the approach depends on whether you have a written agreement.\n\n**If you have a written contract/scope document:**\n'I want to make sure we're on the same page about the project scope. The original agreement covered [list features]. We've since added [list additions], which brings the project to approximately 3x the original scope. I'm happy to continue building these features, but we need to update the contract to reflect the additional work. Here's a change order for the remaining additions: [itemized list with costs].'\n\nThis isn't confrontational — you're referencing a document you both agreed to.\n\n**If you don't have a written contract (the harder case):**\nThis is a learning experience for future projects, but you can still address it:\n'I've been tracking the project evolution, and we've added significantly more features than we initially discussed. Going forward, I'd like to formalize the remaining work so we're both clear on what's included. Here's what I understand is left: [list]. I'll send you a quote for this phase.'\n\n**For the next 'can you also add...' conversation:**\n'That's a great idea and I can definitely build it. It would take approximately X hours of additional work at my rate of $Y. Want me to add it to the scope?'\n\nSay this warmly and matter-of-factly every single time. You're not saying no — you're saying yes, with a price. Most clients respect this.\n\n**Prevention for future projects:**\n- Always have a written scope document\n- Include a clause: 'Additional features requested after agreement will be quoted separately'\n- Specify a number of revision rounds\n- Bill milestone-based (not fixed price for undefined scope)\n\nThe client isn't necessarily acting in bad faith — they may genuinely not realize how much they've added.
