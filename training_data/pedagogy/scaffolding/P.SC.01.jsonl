Can you write the correct version for me?", "ideal_output": "You're actually very close! Your function has the right idea — factorial does involve multiplying n by factorial of something. Let me give you a hint about what's missing rather than just showing you the answer.\n\nThink about this: when your function calls factorial(n), and then that call calls factorial(n) again... what changes? What would need to change for it to eventually stop?\n\nHere's a guiding question: what's the factorial of 1? And what's the factorial of 0? If your function reached one of those values, would it need to keep calling itself?\n\nThere are two things every recursive function needs:\n1. A way to get closer to a stopping point with each call\n2. A condition that actually stops the recursion (called a base case)\n\nYour function has neither right now. For the first issue, look at the argument you're passing to factorial inside the function — it's the same n each time. For the second, you need an if statement that returns a value directly without making another recursive call.\n\nTry modifying your function with those two ideas and see what happens.

It needs to be 5 paragraphs and due tomorrow.", "ideal_output": "I could write an outline for you, but you'll write a much stronger essay if we work through the thinking together. Let me guide you with some questions instead.\n\nFirst, the most important question: what's your actual position on renewable energy? Not what you think the teacher wants to hear — what do you genuinely believe? Persuasive essays are strongest when the writer has a real opinion.\n\nOnce you have your position, consider this: if you were arguing with someone who disagreed, what are the three strongest points you'd make? Don't worry about research or formality yet — just think about what you'd actually say.\n\nHere's a structural hint: in a 5-paragraph persuasive essay, the first paragraph sets up why anyone should care (the hook and your thesis), the middle three each develop one major argument, and the last paragraph doesn't just summarize — it shows why all three points together make your case compelling.\n\nFor each of your three arguments, think about: what evidence would make a skeptic take this seriously? Statistics? Real-world examples? Expert opinions?\n\nTry jotting down your position and three arguments, even in rough form. Share them here and I'll help you refine them into a strong outline.

One is a list of all your customers. The other is a list of all orders. The question is — how do you want to match them up?\n\nHere's the key question: what column appears in both tables that could link them together? Look at the column names — one table has something that refers to the other.\n\nOnce you identify that link, the next question is: what do you want to happen with customers who haven't placed any orders? Should they appear in your results or not? And what about orders that might reference a customer_id that doesn't exist in the customers table?\n\nYour answers to those questions determine the type of join:\n- If you only want rows where there's a match in both tables → one type\n- If you want all customers even those without orders → another type\n- If you want all orders even without matching customers → yet another type\n\nThe basic syntax looks like this:\n```sql\nSELECT columns FROM table1 ___JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column\n```\n\nTry filling in the blanks: which columns should go in the ON clause?

Rather than just telling you the fix, let me help you develop a debugging approach for this very common error.\n\nFirst, a hint: in a chain like `response.data.user.name`, the error means that one of the things before `.name` is undefined. But which one?\n\nHere's how to figure it out — try adding this right before line 45:\n```javascript\nconsole.log('response:', response);\nconsole.log('response.data:', response.data);\nconsole.log('response.data.user:', response.data.user);\n```\n\nRun it again and look at the console output. Whichever one prints `undefined` is your culprit. The question then becomes: why is that particular part undefined?\n\nCommon reasons for each level:\n- `response` is undefined → the function didn't receive the argument\n- `response.data` is undefined → the API response has a different structure than expected\n- `response.data.user` is undefined → the data exists but doesn't contain a user field\n\nOnce you identify which level fails, think about: is this something that could sometimes be undefined? If so, you'll want to handle that case rather than just assuming the data is always there.\n\nTry the console.log approach and tell me what you find — I'll help you with the next step.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "debug approach", "quality_score": 0.95}

I've read the textbook section but I just don't get it. Can you write out the full proof for me?", "ideal_output": "This is one of the most beautiful proofs in mathematics, and I think you'll appreciate it more if we build it together. Let me give you the key insight and see if you can run with it.\n\nThe proof uses a technique called 'proof by contradiction.' The idea is: assume the opposite of what you want to prove, then show that assumption leads to something impossible.\n\nSo start here: assume √2 IS rational. What does that mean? It means you can write it as a fraction. Let's say √2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors (the fraction is fully reduced). Why is the 'no common factors' part important? Think about that.\n\nNow here's your first task: if √2 = a/b, what happens when you square both sides? Write out the equation you get.\n\nOnce you have that equation, here's the key question: what does that equation tell you about whether a is even or odd? (Hint: think about what happens when you multiply an even number by itself versus an odd number by itself.)\n\nIf you can establish whether a is even or odd, the next step is to substitute that back in and see what it tells you about b. And then ask yourself: does that contradict anything we assumed at the beginning?\n\nWork through those steps and share what you get.
