I've never used them before but I need them for a data processing project at work. Where should I start?", "ideal_output": "Let's build up your regex knowledge step by step, starting with the simplest concepts.\n\n**Level 1 — Literal matching:**\nA regex can just be plain text. The pattern `cat` matches the word 'cat' in any text. Nothing fancy. Try thinking: what would the pattern `hello` match?\n\n**Level 2 — The dot (wildcard):**\nA dot `.` matches any single character. So `c.t` matches 'cat', 'cot', 'cut', even 'c3t'. It's like a blank tile in Scrabble.\n\nPractice question: what would `h.t` match?\n\n**Level 3 — Repetition:**\n- `*` means 'zero or more of the previous thing'\n- `+` means 'one or more of the previous thing'\n\nSo `go+gle` matches 'gogle', 'google', 'gooogle', etc. And `go*gle` also matches 'ggle' (zero o's).\n\nThat's enough for today. Try these exercises before we move on:\n1. Write a pattern that matches 'color' and 'colour' (hint: what if the 'u' appears zero or one times?)\n2. Write a pattern that matches any three-letter word starting with 'b' and ending with 't'\n\nOnce you're comfortable with these basics, we'll add character classes (matching specific sets of characters), anchors (matching at the start or end of a line), and groups. Each concept builds on what you already know.\n\nWhat patterns do you need for your work project? Knowing that will help me prioritize which concepts to cover next.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "regex graduated", "quality_score": 0.95}

I can barely boil water. What should I learn first?", "ideal_output": "Everyone starts somewhere, and 'barely boil water' is actually a great starting point because boiling water is the foundation of several easy meals.\n\n**Week 1 goal — Master exactly one dish: pasta with jarred sauce.**\n\nHere's why this is the perfect starter:\n- It teaches you to boil water (a real skill — right amount, salt it, know when it's rolling)\n- It teaches you timing (pasta has a specific cook time)\n- It teaches you tasting as you go (checking if pasta is done)\n- It's almost impossible to mess up badly\n\nThe only skills you need: fill pot, turn on stove, wait, add pasta, set timer, drain. That's it.\n\n**Once you can do that consistently, Week 2:**\n- Sauté garlic and onion in olive oil (introduces using a pan, oil temperature, and not burning things)\n- Add that to your pasta instead of jarred sauce\n\n**Week 3:**\n- Cook a protein — start with scrambled eggs (fast feedback, very forgiving)\n- Learn the concept of seasoning: salt, pepper, taste, adjust\n\n**Week 4:**\n- Combine skills: pasta + sautéed vegetables + protein\n\nNotice how each week adds exactly one new skill to what you already know. You're never juggling multiple new things at once.\n\nStart tonight with the pasta. Don't try to get fancy. Just boil water, cook pasta according to the box time, drain it, add sauce, eat it.

I've always just saved copies of files with different names like 'report_v2_final_FINAL.doc'. Git seems incredibly complicated — branches, merges, rebases, cherry-picks. How do I even begin?", "ideal_output": "Good news: you can be productive with Git using only about 5 commands. The advanced stuff can wait until you actually need it.\n\n**Phase 1 — Solo basics (this is all you need for the first week or two):**\n\n```\ngit init          → Creates a new repository (do this once per project)\ngit add <file>    → Stages a file (says 'I want to save this')\ngit commit -m \"message\"  → Actually saves the snapshot\ngit status        → Shows what's changed since your last save\ngit log           → Shows your save history\n```\n\nThat's it. This replaces your 'report_v2_final_FINAL' system. Each commit is a snapshot you can always go back to, and the message describes what changed.\n\nTry this right now with any project folder. Initialize it, add your files, make a commit.\n\n**Phase 2 — Working with your team (add when you start collaborating):**\n```\ngit clone         → Download the team's project\ngit pull           → Get their latest changes\ngit push           → Share your changes\n```\n\n**Phase 3 — Branches (add when you're comfortable with Phase 2):**\nThis is where you can work on features without affecting others. But don't worry about this yet.\n\n**Ignore for now:** rebase, cherry-pick, stash, bisect, reflog. These are power tools. You don't need a chainsaw to build a birdhouse.\n\nStart with Phase 1 today. Make a folder, run `git init`, create a file, `git add` it, `git commit` it. Then change the file, commit again. Look at `git log`.

My team keeps running A/B tests and I nod along in meetings but I honestly don't know what p-values or confidence intervals mean. Can you explain it all?", "ideal_output": "Let's build this up from everyday intuition rather than math formulas.\n\n**Concept 1 — The coin flip question:**\nIf you flip a coin 10 times and get 7 heads, is the coin unfair? Probably not — that can happen by luck. What about 10 heads out of 10? Now you're suspicious. Statistical significance is just a formal way of asking: 'Could this result have happened by luck alone?'\n\nThat's it. That's the core idea. Everything else is details.\n\n**Concept 2 — The p-value (once you get Concept 1):**\nThe p-value answers: 'If there's really no difference between A and B, what's the probability I'd see a result this extreme just by chance?'\n\nIn your A/B tests: if version B got 5% more clicks than version A, the p-value tells you how likely it is that this 5% difference is just random noise. A p-value of 0.03 means there's only a 3% chance the difference is just luck.\n\nYour team probably uses p < 0.05 as the threshold — meaning they want less than 5% chance it's luck before they call it 'real.'\n\n**That's enough for your next meeting.** You can now understand the key statement: 'The result was statistically significant with p = 0.02' means 'There's only a 2% chance this difference is random noise.'\n\nWhen you're ready, we can add:\n- Concept 3: Confidence intervals (a range instead of a single number)\n- Concept 4: Sample size (why more data = more reliable results)\n- Concept 5: Practical significance vs. statistical significance (the difference your team should really care about)\n\nWhich concept would be most useful for your next meeting?", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "statistics graduated", "quality_score": 0.95}

I can't read music at all. Should I start with music theory, scales, chords, or just try to learn a song? There's so much to learn I feel paralyzed.", "ideal_output": "The paralysis comes from trying to plan the whole journey at once. Let's narrow it down to literally the first thing you should do when you sit at that keyboard.\n\n**Step 1 (right now, today):**\nFind middle C. It's the C nearest to the center of your keyboard. Play it with your right thumb. Now play the next white key up (D) with your index finger. Then E with your middle finger. C-D-E. Play those three notes a few times. Congratulations, you've played the beginning of 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' (E-D-C-D-E-E-E).\n\nSeriously, stop there today. Get comfortable finding those keys without looking.\n\n**Step 2 (tomorrow):**\nLearn all 5 notes from C to G using your five right-hand fingers, one per key. Play up (C-D-E-F-G) and down (G-F-E-D-C). This is called a five-finger position.\n\n**Step 3 (next few days):**\nLearn one simple song that uses only those 5 notes. 'Ode to Joy' works perfectly. You can find the letter names online — no sheet music reading needed yet.\n\n**Step 4 (once Step 3 feels easy):**\nAdd your left hand playing just single notes — start with C and G below middle C.\n\nNotice I haven't mentioned theory, scales, or chord progressions. Those become relevant later, and they'll make much more sense once your fingers have some experience on the keys.\n\nThe most important principle: play something that sounds like music as quickly as possible. Theory without playing is boring. Playing without theory is fun and you can add theory later.\n\nGo find middle C right now and play E-D-C-D-E-E-E.
