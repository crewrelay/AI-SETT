Can you show me how?", "ideal_output": "I'll give you the structure and the first part — you fill in the critical logic.\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(sorted_list) - 1\n    \n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        \n        if sorted_list[mid] == target:\n            return mid  # Found it!\n        \n        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:\n            # The target is bigger than the middle element.\n            # Which half of the list should you search next?\n            # Update either 'left' or 'right' to narrow the search.\n            # YOUR CODE HERE\n            pass\n        \n        else:\n            # The target is smaller than the middle element.\n            # Which half should you search now?\n            # YOUR CODE HERE\n            pass\n    \n    return -1  # Not found\n```\n\nThe key insight: binary search works by eliminating half the remaining elements each time. You've already seen the `==` case (found the target). For the other two cases, you need to figure out:\n\n- If the target is bigger than the middle element, it must be in the _____ half. So you should move the _____ pointer.\n- If the target is smaller, it's in the _____ half. So you move the _____ pointer.\n\nAnd what value should you set the pointer to? Not `mid` itself — think about why.\n\nFill in the two missing sections. Test with: `binary_search([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11], 7)` — it should return 3.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "algorithm partial", "quality_score": 0.95}

By default (row direction):\n- The main axis is horizontal → `justify-content` controls it\n- The cross axis is vertical → a different property controls it\n\nThe property name starts with `align-` and ends with a word related to what `justify-content` does for the main axis.\n\nFill in that one property and test it in your browser.
