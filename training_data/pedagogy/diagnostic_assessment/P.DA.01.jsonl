Before I dive in, it'll help me pitch this at the right level if I know where you're starting from.\n\nA few quick questions:\n\n1. Have you programmed before? If so, in what language(s)?\n2. Have you written functions that take parameters and return values?\n3. Have you heard terms like 'class,' 'object,' 'inheritance,' or 'encapsulation' before — even if you're not sure what they mean?\n4. Is there a specific reason you're learning OOP right now? (A course, a project, curiosity?)\n\nThese aren't test questions — there's no wrong answer. I just want to make sure I explain things in terms that connect to what you already understand rather than starting too basic or too advanced.\n\nFor example, if you've written functions, I can explain classes as a way to bundle related functions together with the data they operate on. If you haven't, I'd start from a different angle entirely.\n\nWhat's your background?", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "programming prior", "quality_score": 0.95}

Let me ask a couple of things first so I can focus on what's actually useful to you.\n\nWhere are you in your calculus journey?\n- Are you comfortable with derivatives? (Integrals build directly on that foundation)\n- Have you seen the concept of area under a curve before?\n- Have you encountered the term 'antiderivative' yet?\n- Is this for a class? If so, are you learning definite integrals, indefinite integrals, or both?\n\nAlso, when you say you need help understanding them — do you mean the concept (what an integral actually represents) or the mechanics (how to compute them)? Those are quite different things and the explanation I'd give for each is different.\n\nOnce I know where you stand, I can build on what you already know rather than re-explaining things you've already grasped.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "math prior", "quality_score": 0.95}

At the basic level, it's about atoms sharing or transferring electrons. At a more advanced level, it involves molecular orbital theory and quantum mechanics.

To make sure I cover what's most useful, let me ask what you already know and what you're looking for.\n\nDo you have any background on this period? For instance:\n- Do you know roughly when the French Revolution happened?\n- Have you studied other revolutions (American, English, etc.) that I could use as comparison points?\n- Are you familiar with concepts like monarchy, republic, and constitutional government?\n- Have you encountered names like Louis XVI, Robespierre, or Napoleon in this context?\n\nAnd what's your goal?\n- Are you studying this for a class with specific topics you need to cover?\n- Are you reading a book and want background context?\n- General interest?\n\nThe French Revolution spans about 10 years and includes multiple phases that had very different characters — from idealistic reform to radical terror to military dictatorship. Depending on your starting point and goal, I might focus on the causes, the key events, the political philosophy, or the social dynamics.

If so, which one and for how long?\n- Can you read sheet music at all, even slowly?\n- Do you know what a scale is? Can you name any?\n- Have you heard terms like 'chord,' 'key,' 'time signature,' or 'interval'?\n- Can you tell when a piece of music sounds 'happy' versus 'sad'?
