Can you quiz me to make sure?", "ideal_output": "Sure. These questions are designed to check understanding, not memorize facts. Take your time.\n\n**Question 1 (Conceptual):**\nYou have an online bookstore. A customer can buy multiple books, and a book can be bought by multiple customers. How many database tables would you need to represent this relationship? Don't worry about the exact columns — just the number of tables and what each one represents.\n\n**Question 2 (Practical reasoning):**\nYou have a table with 10 million user records. You frequently search by email address. Right now, that search takes 30 seconds. Without changing your query or your hardware, what's one thing you could add to the database to make that search much faster? Why would it help?\n\n**Question 3 (Understanding trade-offs):**\nSomeone suggests storing a customer's full address directly in the orders table (so every order row contains the customer's street, city, zip code). What's one advantage and one disadvantage of this approach compared to storing the address in a separate customers table and referencing it?\n\n**Question 4 (Debugging):**\nYou write a query to count how many orders each customer has placed, but customers with zero orders don't appear in your results at all. You're using a JOIN between customers and orders. What type of JOIN are you probably using, and what should you change it to?\n\nAnswer whichever ones you feel confident about.

Is this supervised or unsupervised learning? What would you need to have before you could train the model?\n\n**Question 2 (Tricky case):**\nYou have purchase history for 50,000 customers and you want to find natural groupings of customers with similar buying patterns — but you don't know in advance what the groups should be. Supervised or unsupervised? Why?\n\n**Question 3 (The interesting edge):**\nYou have 10,000 images of cats and dogs. You have labels for 100 of them. You want to classify all 10,000. Is this supervised, unsupervised, or something else? What would you do with the 9,900 unlabeled images?\n\n**Question 4 (Applied reasoning):**\nSomeone trains a supervised model to predict house prices. The model gets 99% accuracy on the training data but only 60% on new data. What's happening? Is this a problem with supervised learning itself, or with how this person used it?\n\nThe first two test whether you can correctly categorize scenarios.

If not, which one(s) can't you change and what happens if you try?\n\n**Question 2:**\nWhat does this code print, and why?\n```javascript\nlet a = 10;\nlet b = a;\na = 20;\nconsole.log(b);\n```\n\n**Question 3:**\nWhat's the value of `result` and why?\n```javascript\nlet result = \"5\" + 3;\n```\nFollow-up: what about `\"5\" - 3`?\n\n**Question 4:**\nWithout running this code, what do you think `x` is at the end?\n```javascript\nlet x;\nconsole.log(x);\n```\n\nDon't look these up — give me your best guess for each one.

Walk me through what happens, step by step, before you see the Google homepage. Be as specific as you can — the more steps you can name, the more I'll know about your understanding.\n\n**Question 2 (Why, not what):**\nWhy does TCP break data into packets instead of sending the whole thing at once? What problem does that solve?\n\n**Question 3 (Distinguish similar things):**\nWhat's the difference between TCP and UDP? Don't just list properties — give me a scenario where you'd choose UDP over TCP and explain why TCP would be worse for that scenario.\n\n**Question 4 (Practical application):**\nYou're on a video call and the audio keeps cutting out but the call doesn't drop. Is the video call more likely using TCP or UDP? How does your answer explain the symptoms you're experiencing?\n\n**Question 5 (Understanding layers):**\nIf IP addresses identify computers on the network, what identifies the specific application on that computer? Why do we need both?\n\nThe first question tests breadth. The others test whether you understand the reasoning behind the protocols, not just the facts about them.

Any way to check if I'm missing anything?", "ideal_output": "Let's find out with some targeted questions. These progress from fundamental to tricky.\n\n**Level 1 — Basics:**\nWrite a query that finds all customers from the 'customers' table whose last name starts with 'S' and who signed up in 2024. (Just checking syntax comfort.)\n\n**Level 2 — Joins:**\nYou have 'orders' (order_id, customer_id, amount) and 'customers' (id, name). Write a query that shows each customer's name and their total spending. Include customers who haven't ordered anything (they should show $0 or NULL).\n\n**Level 3 — Subqueries:**\nUsing the same tables: find all customers whose total spending is above the average total spending across all customers. (This requires a subquery or CTE.)\n\n**Level 4 — Window functions:**\nFor each order, show the customer_id, amount, and the running total of that customer's orders (ordered by order_id). Can you do this without a subquery?\n\n**Level 5 — Gotcha:**\nWhat does this query return, and why might the result surprise you?\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE amount > NULL;\n```\n\nTry all five.
