You've shown you understand the loop structure and using an accumulator variable.\n\nSince you've got the basics down, I'm going to give you a challenge with less guidance than before. Earlier I walked you through step by step — now I'll describe what to build and let you figure out the approach.\n\n**Challenge:** Write a function that takes a list of words and returns only the words that are longer than 5 characters.\n\nHints I'm intentionally not giving you this time:\n- I'm not telling you which type of loop to use (you know this)\n- I'm not showing you the structure of the function (you've seen enough examples)\n- I'm not reminding you about the comparison operator (you used it in your sum exercise)\n\nOne concept you'll need that's new: you'll want to build up a new list inside your loop. Think about how you built up a sum — same idea, but with a list instead of a number.\n\nTry it, and share your code whether it works or not. If you get stuck for more than 10 minutes on a specific part, tell me what's blocking you and I'll give you a targeted hint for just that part.\n\nAfter this, if you nail it, the next challenge will come with no hints at all — just a problem description.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "code scaffold fade", "quality_score": 0.95}

You touched on this in your last paragraph with the statistics you included — extend that instinct.\n\nWrite it and share it. My feedback will focus on the aspects you haven't practiced yet — transitions between paragraphs, building an overall arc, and anticipating counterarguments — rather than the paragraph-level structure you've already got.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "writing scaffold fade", "quality_score": 0.95}

Chain rule is solid.\n\nTime to remove another layer of support. So far I've been choosing problems that isolate one rule at a time. Now you'll need to decide which rules to apply.\n\nDifferentiate these:\n\n1. f(x) = x³ · sin(x)\n2. g(x) = (3x² + 1)⁴ / x\n3. h(x) = ln(cos(x²))\n\nI'm not labeling which rule each one needs. Part of the skill is recognizing 'oh, this is a product rule situation' or 'this needs chain rule' on your own. Problem 3 requires you to stack multiple rules — that's the real-world reality of calculus problems.\n\nJust show me your work and final answers.

You already know the foundational techniques:\n- Building a flavor base (you've done garlic, onion, ginger)\n- Managing heat\n- Timing ingredients\n- Seasoning and adjusting\n\nDecide what kind of soup sounds good. Think about what protein and vegetables you want. Consider what liquid (broth, coconut milk, tomato-based). You know how to sauté aromatics as a starting point.\n\nThe only guidance I'll offer: taste it three times during cooking — early, middle, and right before serving. Adjust salt each time.\n\nIf it comes out bland or something goes wrong, tell me what happened and we'll troubleshoot. But I think you're past the point of needing step-by-step instructions.
