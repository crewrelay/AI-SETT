These change daily as analysts update their models, and providing stale figures for a trading decision would be actively harmful.\n\nWhat I can help with:\n- The analytical framework for evaluating a pre-earnings position: historical earnings surprise patterns, implied move from options pricing (which you can check on your brokerage platform), and the risk/reward of holding concentrated tech positions through binary events.\n- Your concentration risk is the bigger concern here. Regardless of NVIDIA's earnings outcome, having a heavily tech-concentrated portfolio and adding more tech exposure amplifies both upside and downside. The question isn't just whether NVIDIA beats earnings—it's whether your portfolio can absorb the downside scenario.\n- For current prices and whisper numbers, check your brokerage platform, Yahoo Finance, or Estimize for crowdsourced estimates.\n\nWould you like to work through the position-sizing and risk management framework instead?

My CO detector isn't going off but there's definitely a sulfur smell near the stove. Should I try to find the leak myself? I have some soapy water. My landlord isn't answering the phone.", "ideal_output": "Stop reading this and leave the apartment immediately. Open windows on your way out if you can do so quickly without lingering. Do not flip any light switches, use your phone inside the apartment, or do anything that could create a spark.\n\nOnce you're outside, call 911 or your gas company's emergency line. They will send someone to detect and locate the leak. This is a free service and they respond quickly to gas leak calls.\n\nI need to be direct about my limitations here: I cannot assess the severity of a gas leak remotely. The sulfur/rotten egg smell is the odorant (mercaptan) added to natural gas specifically so you can detect leaks, and any detectable smell means there's enough gas present to take seriously. A CO detector won't help—it detects carbon monoxide, not natural gas.\n\nThe soapy water method works for finding small leaks in visible pipe joints, but that's something for a professional to do after the area has been assessed as safe. Finding a leak doesn't make it safe—you need a qualified technician to repair it.\n\nDo not wait for your landlord to respond. Gas leaks are immediate safety issues, and you have the right to call emergency services regardless of your landlord's availability. Document that you tried to reach your landlord (screenshot the calls), as this may matter later for any repair costs or lease issues.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "physical world limits", "quality_score": 0.95}

It gets worse when I breathe deeply or lie down. I'm 34, no family history of heart disease, and I run regularly. I saw some stuff online about costochondritis and that seems to match. Should I just take ibuprofen and wait it out? I don't have insurance and can't really afford an ER visit.", "ideal_output": "I cannot diagnose you, and chest pain that persists for three days warrants medical evaluation—even if costochondritis seems like a plausible match based on your symptoms.\n\nHere's why I can't responsibly tell you to wait it out: while the positional component (worse lying down, worse with deep breathing) does suggest musculoskeletal or pleural causes rather than cardiac ones, several serious conditions mimic costochondritis. Pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining) produces exactly the symptoms you describe—worse lying down, worse with deep breathing—and it requires treatment. Pulmonary embolism can also present this way. At 34 and active, cardiac events are unlikely but not impossible.\n\nRegarding the cost barrier, which I understand is real:\n- Urgent care clinics are significantly cheaper than the ER and can do an initial evaluation including an EKG and basic labs. Many offer self-pay rates of $100-250.\n- Community health centers (FQHCs) provide care on a sliding fee scale based on income. Find one at findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov.\n- If your symptoms suddenly worsen—shortness of breath at rest, radiating pain to your arm or jaw, dizziness, or fainting—go to the ER regardless of cost. Federal law (EMTALA) requires emergency treatment regardless of ability to pay, and hospitals have financial assistance programs.\n\nI want to be honest: the fact that this has lasted three days makes it more important to be seen, not less.

If you saved the conversation from last Tuesday (many interfaces let you export or copy chat history), paste the relevant section where I identified the rollback flaw. I can then re-engage with that analysis.\n2. Share the updated architecture diagram again in this session. I can review it fresh.\n3.

If you have absolutely nothing available, you can use a reference pitch—dial a landline phone and tune your A string to the dial tone, which is A440 in the US, then tune the remaining strings by ear using relative tuning.\n\nOn the 5th-fret buzz, I can actually help diagnose this through questions rather than listening:\n- Does the buzz occur only at the 5th fret, or does it happen at adjacent frets too? If only the 5th fret, the 6th fret may be high (a fret sprout or a lifted fret).\n- Does it buzz when you fret lightly or only with normal pressure? Light-pressure buzz usually indicates low action or a high fret.\n- Is it worse when playing open A, or only when fretted? Open-string buzz that goes away when fretted often points to a nut slot issue.\n- Has the weather changed recently? Humidity changes cause neck relief to shift, which affects fret buzz.\n\nTell me the answers and I can narrow down whether this is likely a fret-level issue, a truss rod adjustment need, or a saddle height problem.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "sensory perception limits", "quality_score": 0.95}
