I just got called back for additional imaging and I'm terrified.", "ideal_output": "The short answer is: most positive screening mammograms are false positives. The callback rate for additional imaging is approximately 10-12% of all screening mammograms, and of those callbacks, roughly 80-90% turn out to be benign findings. Only about 4-5% of diagnostic callbacks ultimately result in a cancer diagnosis.\n\nI'm fairly confident in these figures because they come from large, well-replicated datasets (the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium tracks millions of mammograms annually), and the base rates are well-established. However, I want to be precise about what I'm more and less certain of:\n\nHigh confidence: The vast majority of callbacks are not cancer. This is a statistical near-certainty based on the base rate of breast cancer in the screening population (roughly 5 per 1,000 women screened) combined with the sensitivity and specificity of mammography.\n\nModerate confidence: Your individual probability depends on factors I don't know—your age, breast density, family history, whether this is your first mammogram or whether there's a comparison available, and what the radiologist saw. A callback for calcifications carries different implications than one for a mass. BI-RADS category matters enormously: a BI-RADS 0 (need more imaging) is much less concerning than a BI-RADS 4 (suspicious).\n\nLow confidence / cannot estimate: Your specific probability given your specific imaging findings. That requires a radiologist reviewing your actual images.\n\nWhat I can say with confidence: the anxiety you're feeling is disproportionate to the statistical likelihood of cancer. This isn't to dismiss your feelings—the fear is natural and common. But the numbers are genuinely reassuring for the average callback.

Should my company start preparing now?", "ideal_output": "I'll break this into components with different confidence levels, because the answer spans established facts and genuine uncertainty.\n\n**Near-certain:** Sufficiently powerful quantum computers could break RSA and ECC encryption using Shor's algorithm. This is mathematically proven—not speculative. Any encryption relying on the difficulty of factoring large numbers or computing discrete logarithms is theoretically vulnerable.\n\n**Near-certain:** Symmetric encryption (AES) and hash functions are much less affected. Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for brute-force search, meaning AES-256 would have the effective security of AES-128—still computationally infeasible to break. You don't need to worry about AES becoming obsolete.\n\n**Moderately confident:** Cryptographically relevant quantum computers (capable of breaking RSA-2048) do not currently exist and will not exist for several years. Current quantum computers have hundreds to low thousands of noisy qubits. Breaking RSA-2048 would require roughly 4,000 error-corrected logical qubits, which translates to millions of physical qubits given current error rates. IBM, Google, and others have published roadmaps, but engineering challenges remain substantial.\n\n**Low confidence (genuine uncertainty):** The timeline for cryptographically relevant quantum computing. Estimates from credible researchers range from 10 to 30+ years. I don't have a reliable basis for choosing a specific year. Anyone who gives you a confident date is overstating their knowledge.\n\n**High confidence on the preparation question:** Yes, your company should start preparing, regardless of the uncertain timeline. Here's why: NIST finalized post-quantum cryptography standards (CRYSTALS-Kyber for key exchange, CRYSTALS-Dilithium for signatures) in 2024. Migration takes years for large systems. And there's a \"harvest now, decrypt later\" threat—adversaries can store your encrypted data today and decrypt it when quantum computers arrive. If your data needs to remain confidential for 10+ years, the threat is present-tense.\n\nPractical first steps: inventory where your systems use RSA/ECC, prioritize data with long confidentiality requirements, and begin testing NIST PQC algorithms in non-production environments.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "calibrated tech prediction", "quality_score": 0.95}

Everyone says the legal tech market is booming and lawyers who can code are in huge demand. Is this true? What are the realistic prospects?", "ideal_output": "Let me calibrate the hype against what I can actually substantiate.\n\n**Confident this is true:** There is genuine demand for people who understand both law and technology. Legal tech companies (contract analysis, e-discovery, compliance automation) value domain expertise that pure engineers lack. Corporate legal departments increasingly need people who can evaluate and implement technology solutions. Law firms are adopting AI tools and need people who can bridge the gap.\n\n**Confident this is overstated:** \"Lawyers who can code are in huge demand\" is a LinkedIn-grade oversimplification. The demand is real but narrow. Most legal tech companies want either experienced software engineers OR experienced lawyers for product/strategy roles—rarely someone doing both simultaneously. A lawyer who learned Python is not competitive with a software engineer for engineering roles, and shouldn't try to be.\n\n**Moderately confident about the realistic paths:**\n- Product management at legal tech companies: Strong fit for your background. You understand the user, the workflow, and the regulatory constraints. This doesn't require deep coding skills—it requires technology literacy.\n- Legal operations / legal tech implementation at large companies or firms: Growing field, compensation comparable to mid-level practice, better work-life balance.\n- Starting a legal tech company: High risk, high reward. Your domain expertise is your competitive advantage. You'd likely need a technical co-founder rather than trying to build the technology yourself.\n- Compliance and regulatory roles at tech companies: Your legal expertise applied to tech company problems (data privacy, AI governance, content moderation policy).\n\n**What I'm less confident about:** Compensation expectations. Senior lawyers at major firms earn $300K-$1M+. Most of the legal tech roles I described pay $150K-$250K, potentially with equity. Whether this is a \"step down\" depends on your current earnings and how you value lifestyle factors. I'm uncertain about exact current salary ranges and they vary significantly by market.\n\n**What I'd push back on:** The framing of \"transitioning to tech\" as if it's a single destination. The roles above are very different from each other.

I'm writing a piece for my local newspaper and I want to get the science right.", "ideal_output": "This is an area where precision matters enormously, because the science supports some claims very strongly and others only weakly—and conflating them undermines credibility in both directions.\n\n**High confidence (well-established in the literature):**\n- Climate change is making hurricanes that DO form more intense. Warmer ocean surface temperatures provide more energy for tropical cyclone intensification. The proportion of hurricanes reaching Category 4-5 intensity has increased.\n- Sea level rise (which is unambiguously linked to climate change) means any given hurricane produces worse storm surge flooding than it would have decades ago.\n- Hurricanes are producing more rainfall. Warmer air holds more moisture (about 7% more per degree Celsius, per the Clausius-Clapeyron relation). Hurricane Harvey's extreme rainfall in 2017 was made significantly more likely by climate change—this was established by rapid attribution studies.\n- Rapid intensification events (hurricanes strengthening dramatically in a short period) are increasing, making forecasting more difficult and evacuation timelines shorter.\n\n**Low to moderate confidence (actively debated in the literature):**\n- Whether the total NUMBER of hurricanes is increasing. The global frequency of tropical cyclones has not shown a clear upward trend. Some models predict fewer but more intense storms. The observational record is complicated by improved detection capabilities—we find more storms now because we have better satellite coverage, not necessarily because there are more storms.\n- Whether individual hurricanes can be attributed to climate change. Attribution science has advanced significantly, but individual storm attribution remains probabilistic (\"climate change made this storm X% more likely or Y% more intense\") rather than binary.\n\n**For your newspaper piece, I'd recommend:**\nDon't write \"climate change is causing more hurricanes\"—the frequency claim isn't well-supported. Do write \"climate change is making hurricanes more dangerous\"—stronger storms, more rainfall, worse flooding.

How reliable are software project estimates? Our engineering team consistently underestimates by 50-100%. Is there a methodology that actually works?", "ideal_output": "I can give you a confident meta-answer and a less confident set of recommendations.\n\n**High confidence (extensively documented):**\nSoftware project estimation is systematically and predictably inaccurate across the entire industry. This isn't your team's failing—it's a well-documented phenomenon. Standish Group data, Capers Jones's research, and multiple meta-analyses consistently show that large software projects exceed their estimates by 50-100% on average. Your team's experience is the norm, not the exception.\n\nThe reasons are structural, not motivational: unknown unknowns (requirements that emerge during development), integration complexity that's invisible during planning, optimism bias (Daniel Kahneman's \"planning fallacy\"), and the fact that novel engineering work is inherently less predictable than manufacturing.\n\n**Moderate confidence (evidence supports these approaches but results vary):**\n\nReference class forecasting works better than bottom-up estimation. Instead of estimating from first principles (\"this feature needs 3 components, each takes 2 days\"), look at how long similar past projects actually took and use that as your baseline. Kahneman advocates this approach specifically.\n\nEstimation in ranges rather than points is more honest and more useful. Instead of \"this will take 6 weeks,\" say \"this will take 4-10 weeks, with 80% confidence.\" This forces explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty and gives stakeholders useful information for planning.\n\nBreaking work into smaller increments (2-week sprints, vertical slices) reduces per-increment estimation error, even though it doesn't eliminate it. Smaller estimates tend to be less wrong than larger ones.\n\n**Lower confidence (some evidence, contested):**\nWhether any specific estimation methodology (story points, #NoEstimates, Monte Carlo simulation, evidence-based scheduling) consistently outperforms others in practice. The evidence is largely anecdotal and context-dependent. What seems to matter more than the specific technique is whether the team has a feedback loop—comparing estimates to actuals and adjusting their calibration over time.\n\nThe practical advice I'm most confident in: plan for your estimates to be wrong, build buffers explicitly, and communicate uncertainty as a feature of reality rather than a failure of your team.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "calibrated software estimate", "quality_score": 0.95}
