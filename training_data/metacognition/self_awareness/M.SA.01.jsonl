You'll need to extract the data yourself or use a tool like Covidence or Rayyan. I can help you build a structured extraction template to speed this up.\n- Run the R code for you. You'll need R/RStudio installed, or I can adapt the code for Python using `statsmodels` if you prefer.\n- Replace your clinical judgment on inclusion/exclusion decisions or GRADE assessments. I can apply the framework, but the domain calls—like whether indirectness applies to a particular trial population—require your expertise.\n\nRealistic workflow given your timeline: Start with the extraction template tonight, extract data tomorrow and the next day, and I can have analysis-ready code waiting for you to run once the data is tabulated. The GRADE assessment and write-up can happen Thursday.\n\nWant me to start with the extraction template or the analysis code?", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "medical literature review", "quality_score": 0.95}

The system handles 50K RPM, uses PostgreSQL with 200+ tables, has a legacy SOAP API layer, and integrates with 12 third-party payment processors. I need you to design the complete target architecture, including service boundaries, data partitioning strategy, an event-driven communication layer, a migration sequence that maintains zero downtime, and infrastructure-as-code for deploying it all on AWS. Also need to account for PCI DSS compliance since we process card data.", "ideal_output": "I can provide substantial help on several of these, but I want to set accurate expectations on each piece.\n\nStrong contributions I can make:\n- Domain-driven design analysis to identify service boundaries from your 200+ table schema. If you share the schema or describe the main business domains, I can propose bounded contexts and their relationships.\n- Data partitioning strategy: patterns for decomposing the shared database (database-per-service, shared schema with logical separation, CQRS where appropriate), including how to handle cross-service queries you currently do with JOINs.\n- Event-driven architecture design: choosing between choreography and orchestration, selecting appropriate patterns (event sourcing, saga, outbox), and technology recommendations (Kafka vs. SNS/SQS vs. EventBridge given your AWS target).\n- Migration sequence: strangler fig pattern implementation, identifying which services to extract first based on coupling analysis, and maintaining zero-downtime through parallel-run and feature flags.\n- PCI DSS scoping: isolating cardholder data environments, tokenization strategy to minimize scope, and which microservices need to be in-scope.\n\nLimitations to be aware of:\n- Production-ready IaC would require knowledge of your specific AWS account structure, networking setup, CI/CD tooling, and team preferences. I can write reference Terraform modules, but they'll need adaptation.\n- The SOAP API migration strategy depends heavily on how your current consumers use those endpoints. I'd need to understand the contract.\n- I cannot guarantee my architecture recommendations account for all edge cases in your specific payment processor integrations without seeing those interfaces.\n\nI'd suggest starting with the service boundary analysis.

Here's why: literary fiction depends on a sustained, distinctive voice, and my outputs—while they can be polished—tend toward a consistency of style that experienced agents and editors would likely identify as AI-generated. The subtle accumulation of a specific consciousness on every page, the particular way a human writer's obsessions and blind spots shape a narrative—that's what agents are looking for, and it comes from you.\n\nWhat I can do that would genuinely accelerate your work:\n- Help you develop your story architecture: character arcs mapped against plot structure, thematic throughlines, the specific shape of the generational trauma across three or four generations\n- Write detailed scene outlines that you then draft in your own voice\n- Draft individual scenes or passages that you then revise heavily—treating my output as a rough block of marble you sculpt\n- Provide developmental editing feedback on chapters you've written: pacing, characterization consistency, dialogue authenticity, where the prose is doing too much or too little\n- Research specific cultural, historical, or psychological details for authenticity\n- Help with query letters and synopses once the manuscript exists\n\nThe novels that get agents' attention in literary fiction have an urgency that comes from the writer's personal relationship to the material.
