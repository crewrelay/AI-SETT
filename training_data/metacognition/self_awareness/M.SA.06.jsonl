We're considering raising a Series A. What should our valuation be?", "ideal_output": "Before I can reason about valuation, I need to surface several assumptions that dramatically affect the answer—some of which you may not have stated because they seem obvious from inside your company, but which investors will scrutinize.\n\n**Assumptions I'm making (correct me if wrong):**\n\n1. I'm assuming your 15% MoM growth is measured on net new ARR, not just logo count. If you're adding customers but they're smaller than your existing base, or if you have significant churn that the net number masks, the growth story changes substantially.\n\n2. I'm assuming \"$2M ARR\" means current run rate based on contracted recurring revenue, not including one-time fees, professional services, or usage-based revenue that might not recur. Investors will strip non-recurring components.\n\n3. I'm assuming relatively low churn. At 15% MoM growth, you could be growing 20% gross and churning 5%—that's a very different business than growing 15% with near-zero churn.\n\n4. I'm assuming this growth rate is recent and possibly accelerating. If you sustained 15% MoM for 12 months, your ARR would be approximately $10.7M at year-end. VCs will want to see the trajectory curve, not just the current rate.\n\n5. I'm assuming you're pre-profit, burning cash, and the Series A is to accelerate growth rather than reach profitability.\n\n**With those assumptions, rough valuation range:**\n\nB2B SaaS Series A valuations in the current market (post-2022 correction) typically fall at 20-50x ARR for companies with your growth profile, putting you at $40M-$100M pre-money. The wide range reflects uncertainty about the assumptions above, plus factors like market size (TAM), competitive positioning, team, and capital efficiency (how much did you spend to reach $2M ARR?).\n\n**The assumption that matters most and is hardest to verify from outside:** whether your 15% MoM growth rate is sustainable, or whether you're about to hit a growth ceiling as you exhaust your initial market segment. The difference between a company that will sustain 15% MoM for 6 more months and one that will decelerate to 5% MoM is a 3x difference in valuation.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "business assumption surfacing", "quality_score": 0.95}

How can people still justify eating something that's probably carcinogenic?", "ideal_output": "Your conclusion may be reasonable for some people, but the reasoning as stated relies on several assumptions that need examination.\n\n**Assumption 1: That Group 2A classification means the risk is substantial.**\n\nThe WHO/IARC classification system grades the *strength of evidence* that something can cause cancer, not the *magnitude of the risk*. Group 2A (\"probably carcinogenic\") means there is strong evidence of a causal mechanism but limited evidence in humans. Importantly, processed meat is Group 1 (\"carcinogenic to humans\")—the same category as tobacco smoking—but this does NOT mean they carry equal risk. Smoking increases lung cancer risk by approximately 2,000%. The IARC's own data suggests processed meat increases colorectal cancer risk by about 18% per 50g daily serving. These are radically different magnitudes of risk placed in similar-sounding categories.\n\n**Assumption 2: That carcinogenicity is the only relevant health dimension.**\n\nRed meat provides bioavailable iron (heme iron), B12, zinc, complete protein, and creatine. For some populations—pregnant women at risk of iron-deficiency anemia, elderly individuals with sarcopenia, people in food-insecure environments—the nutritional benefits may outweigh the cancer risk, which is dose-dependent and primarily associated with high consumption (>500g/week in most epidemiological studies).\n\n**Assumption 3: That the epidemiological evidence is unconfounded.**\n\nMost studies linking red meat to cancer are observational cohort studies. People who eat more red meat also tend to smoke more, exercise less, eat fewer vegetables, and differ in socioeconomic status. Researchers attempt to control for these confounders, but residual confounding is acknowledged in the literature. The evidence is suggestive but less definitive than the Group 2A label implies to non-specialists.\n\n**Assumption 4: That \"stop eating\" is the only rational response to a dose-dependent risk.**\n\nIf the risk is dose-dependent (and the evidence suggests it is), then moderation rather than elimination is a rational response. Reducing consumption to 2-3 servings per week while emphasizing unprocessed over processed forms addresses most of the identified risk.\n\nI'm not arguing red meat is harmless—the evidence for colorectal cancer risk at high consumption levels is genuine.

She clearly doesn't understand the material. How do I get her a tutor to catch up before she falls behind permanently?", "ideal_output": "I want to examine several assumptions in your framing before we discuss tutoring, because acting on the wrong premise could lead to an intervention that misses the actual issue or creates new problems.\n\n**Assumption: \"78 means she doesn't understand the material.\"**\n\nA 78 is a C+ in most grading systems. This could mean she doesn't understand the material, but it could also mean:\n- She understands the concepts but makes procedural errors (computation mistakes, sign errors, misreading problems). These are execution issues, not comprehension issues, and they require different interventions.\n- She understands most of the material but has specific gaps. A 78 isn't zero—she got most things right. What specific problems did she miss? If she missed all the word problems but aced the computation, that's a reading comprehension issue, not a math issue.\n- She understood the material but didn't study or was having a bad day. A single test score is a very noisy measurement.\n- The test was poorly designed or the grading was harsh. What's the class average?\n\n**Assumption: \"She will fall behind permanently.\"**\n\nThis assumes math learning is strictly linear and that a poor grade at 14 creates an irreversible deficit. While math does build on prior knowledge, a single rough patch at 14 is recoverable. Many successful math students had difficult semesters. The permanence framing might create anxiety that actually interferes with her learning.\n\n**Assumption: \"A tutor is the right intervention.\"**\n\nTutoring helps when the issue is comprehension—when a student needs concepts explained differently. If the issue is study habits, test anxiety, motivation, or a mismatch between learning style and instruction style, a tutor may not address the root cause.\n\nBefore hiring a tutor:\n1. Look at the actual test. Which problems did she miss and why?\n2. Ask her what happened. Does she feel lost in class, or did she not study enough?\n3. Talk to the teacher. What patterns do they see?\n4. Check if this is a pattern or an outlier. What were her previous test scores?\n\nThis diagnostic step takes one evening and could save you months of tutoring that targets the wrong problem.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "educational assumption check", "quality_score": 0.95}

Our company's revenue dropped 12% since we went remote during COVID and we need to reverse that.", "ideal_output": "There are at least four assumptions embedded in this reasoning that should be examined before making a policy change that will significantly affect employee retention.\n\n**Assumption 1: The 12% revenue drop was caused by remote work.**\n\nThis is a post hoc ergo propter hoc inference—two things happened sequentially, so one must have caused the other. But consider what else happened during and after COVID: consumer spending patterns shifted across entire industries, supply chains disrupted, interest rates changed, competitors entered or exited markets, your customer base may have contracted for their own reasons. Without isolating the remote work variable—which would require comparing your performance to industry benchmarks and pre-COVID trajectories—attributing the revenue drop to remote work is guesswork.\n\nQuestion to investigate: Did your competitors who went remote experience similar declines? Did those who stayed in-office do better?\n\n**Assumption 2: Remote workers are less productive.**\n\nThe research on this is mixed and context-dependent. Stanford's Nicholas Bloom has published extensively on this. Some findings: fully remote work shows modest productivity decreases (about 10-20%) for some task types, but hybrid work (3 days in office) shows productivity equivalent to or slightly above full in-office work. Importantly, productivity effects vary dramatically by role type—collaborative creative work may benefit from in-person interaction, while focused analytical work often benefits from the uninterrupted time remote work provides.\n\nAre you measuring productivity, or are you measuring visibility? These are different things.\n\n**Assumption 3: A mandate will restore the lost productivity (if it was lost).**\n\nForcing employees back to the office doesn't recreate 2019 conditions. The labor market has shifted—many employees took remote positions specifically because they value flexibility. A mandate risks losing your highest-performing employees (who have the most options) while retaining those who can't easily leave. This is adverse selection.\n\n**Assumption 4: \"All employees\" should be treated identically.**\n\nDifferent roles have different collaboration needs. A blanket mandate treats a software engineer writing code and a sales team doing deal reviews as equivalent situations. They aren't.\n\nWhat I'd recommend instead of a mandate: audit your actual productivity data by role and team, survey employees about their preferences and constraints, and pilot a hybrid policy with measurement before committing to a company-wide change.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "policy assumption surfacing", "quality_score": 0.95}

GraphQL will fix our performance problems.", "ideal_output": "Let me surface the assumptions here, because switching API architectures is a significant investment and the premise may not lead to the conclusion you expect.\n\n**Assumption 1: Multiple API calls are the cause of the performance problem.**\n\nSeven API calls on a home screen isn't inherently problematic. With HTTP/2 (which multiplexes requests over a single TCP connection), seven parallel requests can complete in roughly the same wall-clock time as one request, assuming your server can handle them concurrently. The performance issue might actually be:\n- Sequential rather than parallel requests (one waits for another to complete)\n- Slow backend queries underlying those endpoints\n- Large payload sizes with data the mobile app doesn't use\n- Network latency on cellular connections (which affects any protocol equally)\n\nBefore switching architectures, measure what's actually slow. Is it time-to-first-byte (backend processing), transfer time (payload size), or total waterfall time (request sequencing)?\n\n**Assumption 2: GraphQL will reduce total data transfer.**\n\nGraphQL lets clients request exactly the fields they need, which can reduce over-fetching. But in practice: are your 7 REST endpoints actually returning significant amounts of unused data? If each endpoint is already reasonably scoped, the savings from field-level selection may be marginal. And GraphQL introduces overhead: the query itself is transmitted as a POST body, response parsing is more complex, and caching is significantly harder (REST responses are trivially cached by URL; GraphQL POST requests require application-level cache management).\n\n**Assumption 3: One GraphQL query replacing 7 REST calls will be faster.**\n\nA single GraphQL query that resolves 7 different data types may still hit 7 different backend services or database queries on the server side—you've just moved the fan-out from client to server. If those resolvers run sequentially (a common GraphQL implementation mistake), you could actually be slower than parallel REST calls.\n\n**Alternative approaches worth considering first:**\n- A BFF (Backend for Frontend) pattern: one REST endpoint specifically designed for the mobile home screen that aggregates the 7 data sources server-side\n- Implementing HTTP/2 and parallelizing client requests\n- Adding a CDN cache layer for endpoints with cacheable data\n- Reducing payload sizes with sparse fieldsets (many REST frameworks support `?fields=id,name,status`)\n\nGraphQL is a powerful tool for complex, evolving data requirements—but it's not a performance optimization tool, and treating it as one often leads to disappointment.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "technical architecture premises", "quality_score": 0.95}
