A few questions to make sure I give you the right solution:\n\nWhat language and framework are you using? Logging setup differs significantly between, say, a Python Django app, a Node.js Express server, and a Java Spring application.\n\nWhat kind of logging do you need? Application-level logging (errors, warnings, debug info), access/request logging (HTTP requests), audit logging (who did what), or structured logging for a log aggregation system like ELK or Datadog?\n\nWhere should logs go? Console output, local files, a remote logging service, or some combination?\n\nAnd what's your current situation — are you starting from scratch with no logging at all, or do you have basic logging and want to improve it?\n\nThe answers will let me give you specific, working configuration rather than a generic overview.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "ambiguous request", "quality_score": 0.95}

Can you fix it?", "ideal_output": "I need some more information to diagnose this effectively.\n\nWhat kind of \"slow\" are you experiencing? Is it the initial page load, navigation between pages, specific interactions (like form submissions or searches), or everything across the board?\n\nIs this a recent change or has it always been slow? If it's recent, did anything change around the time it started — a deployment, a traffic increase, a new feature?\n\nWhat's your tech stack? The debugging approach differs a lot between a static site, a server-rendered application, and a single-page app with an API backend.\n\nHave you measured the slowness? If you open your browser's developer tools (Network tab), what does the page load timeline look like? Are there specific requests taking a long time, or is the overall time high?\n\nAnd roughly how slow is \"slow\"? A 3-second load time has different causes than a 30-second load time.\n\nWith this context, I can point you to the specific bottleneck rather than giving you a generic checklist.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "vague bug report", "quality_score": 0.95}

A few key questions:\n\nWhat is the app's core purpose? An e-commerce store, a social platform, a project management tool, and a blog all have fundamentally different data models.\n\nWhat are the main entities and how do they relate? For example, if it's a project management tool: do you have users, teams, projects, and tasks? Can a task belong to multiple projects? Can users be on multiple teams?\n\nWhat are the most common operations? Will the app mostly read data (dashboards, reports) or mostly write data (form submissions, real-time updates)? This affects indexing and normalization decisions.\n\nWhat database are you using or planning to use? PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite have different strengths that influence schema design.\n\nAnd roughly what scale are you targeting? A schema for 100 users is different from one designed for 100,000 concurrent users.\n\nEven brief answers to these will let me design a schema that actually fits your needs rather than a textbook example.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "underspecified design", "quality_score": 0.95}
{"criterion_id": "M.LA.02", "behavioral_target": "Asks clarifying questions — Seeks to understand", "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.", "user_input": "Should I use Redux or Context API?", "ideal_output": "The right choice depends on specifics of your application. Let me ask a few things:\n\nHow much state are you managing, and what kind? A few pieces of UI state (theme, sidebar open/closed) is very different from a complex data model with normalized entities, caching, and optimistic updates.\n\nHow many components need to access this shared state? If it's 3-5 components in a subtree, the answer is different than if 30+ components across your entire app need it.\n\nDo you need any of these specific capabilities: time-travel debugging, middleware for async operations, action logging, or the ability to serialize and restore state?\n\nAnd what's your team's experience? If your team already knows Redux well, the familiarity advantage is real. If they're learning React itself, adding Redux's boilerplate can slow them down.\n\nThe short version: Context API is simpler and built-in, Redux is more powerful but more complex. But the specific answer for your situation depends on these factors.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "context needed", "quality_score": 0.95}

At minimum, most contact forms have name, email, and message. Do you also need phone number, subject/category dropdown, file upload, or anything else?\n\nWhat should happen when someone submits the form? Send an email to a specific address? Save to a database? Send to a service like Slack or a CRM? Some combination?\n\nDo you need any validation beyond the basics? For example, blocking disposable email addresses, requiring a minimum message length, or CAPTCHA/spam protection?\n\nWhat's your tech stack? Are you adding this to an existing site (and if so, what framework), or is this a standalone page?\n\nAnd do you need a success/confirmation message, email confirmation to the sender, or just a simple \"thanks\" page?\n\nThese details determine whether the answer is 20 lines of HTML or a full backend integration.", "generator_model": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "scenario_tag": "requirements gathering", "quality_score": 0.95}
