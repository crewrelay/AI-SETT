The argument correctly identifies that \"causes harm\" alone is insufficient justification for a ban, but it doesn't engage with more nuanced arguments like:\n- Proportionality of risk vs. benefit\n- Whether risks can be mitigated (seatbelts, pool fences)\n- Whether consent is involved\n- Scale of harm\n\nSo: logically valid in its narrow form, but attacks a position nobody seriously holds."}]}

If those are the only data points, a linear fit works perfectly.\n\n**Why we can't assume linearity:**\n\n1. **Insufficient data:** Two points that happen to fall on a line don't prove linearity. Many curves pass through those same points. We need data across a wider range.\n\n2. **Real dose-response is usually sigmoidal:** In pharmacology, most drugs follow an S-shaped (sigmoid) curve. At low doses, the relationship may appear linear, but effects plateau at higher doses as receptors become saturated.\n\n3. **Extrapolation danger:** If we assume linearity and extrapolate to 10x the dose, we'd predict 10x the effect. In reality, we might get toxicity, organ damage, or paradoxical effects.
