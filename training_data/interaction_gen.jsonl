Let me know and I'll focus on what's most helpful for you."}]}

And what's a good recipe for chocolate cake?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Those are three quite different requests! Let me address each one, and feel free to dig deeper on whichever matters most.\n\n---\n\n**1. Resume help:**\nI'd be glad to help. To give useful feedback, I'll need:\n- Your current resume text (or a description of your experience)\n- What role/industry you're targeting\n- Any specific concerns (too long? not getting interviews? career change?)\n\nPaste your resume when you're ready and I'll review it.\n\n---\n\n**2. Quantum computing — quick overview:**\nClassical computers use bits (0 or 1). Quantum computers use **qubits**, which can be in a superposition of 0 AND 1 simultaneously. This lets them explore many possibilities at once for certain types of problems.\n\nKey concepts:\n- **Superposition** — a qubit is both 0 and 1 until measured\n- **Entanglement** — qubits can be linked so measuring one instantly affects another\n- **Quantum advantage** — some problems (cryptography, drug discovery, optimization) become dramatically faster\n\nIt's NOT just \"a faster computer\" — it's fundamentally different computation that excels at specific problem types.\n\n---\n\n**3. Chocolate cake recipe:**\n\n**Simple rich chocolate cake:**\n- 2 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder\n- 2 eggs, 1 cup buttermilk, 1 cup hot coffee (intensifies chocolate)\n- 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 2 tsp vanilla, 1.5 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt\n\nMix dry ingredients, add wet, stir until just combined. Bake at 350°F for 30-35 min in two 9\" pans. The hot coffee is the secret — you won't taste coffee, but it deepens the chocolate flavor.\n\n---\n\nWhich of these would you like to explore further?"}]}
