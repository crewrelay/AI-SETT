Housing bubble** — Easy credit and low interest rates fueled a massive rise in home prices. Lenders gave mortgages to borrowers who couldn't afford them (subprime mortgages), often with adjustable rates that started low but would spike.\n\n**2. Securitization** — Banks bundled these risky mortgages into complex financial products (mortgage-backed securities, CDOs) and sold them to investors worldwide. Rating agencies gave many of these products AAA ratings despite the underlying risk.\n\n**3. Excessive leverage** — Financial institutions borrowed heavily to buy these securities, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Some banks had leverage ratios of 30:1 or higher.\n\n**4. The trigger** — When housing prices stopped rising and subprime borrowers began defaulting, the securities backed by those mortgages lost value rapidly. Because they were spread throughout the global financial system, losses appeared everywhere simultaneously.\n\n**5. Systemic collapse** — Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in September 2008. Credit markets froze — banks stopped lending to each other because nobody knew who held toxic assets. This credit freeze spread to the real economy: businesses couldn't get loans, layoffs accelerated, consumer spending dropped.\n\n**6. Regulatory failure** — Derivatives like credit default swaps were largely unregulated. Shadow banking operated outside traditional oversight. Regulators missed or ignored warning signs.\n\n**Consequences:** Global recession, 8.7 million US jobs lost, millions of foreclosures, $19.2 trillion in household wealth destroyed, and the Dodd-Frank Act reforms.\n\nThe core lesson: when risk is hidden, distributed widely, and amplified by leverage, the resulting failure is catastrophic and systemic rather than contained."}]}

This mRNA contains instructions for making a specific protein — in the case of COVID-19 vaccines, the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Your cells' ribosomes read the mRNA and produce copies of that protein. Your immune system then recognizes this protein as foreign and mounts an immune response, producing antibodies and training T-cells. If you later encounter the actual virus, your immune system is prepared to fight it.\n\nThe mRNA itself is temporary — it's broken down by normal cellular processes within days and does not enter the cell nucleus or interact with your DNA. I'm confident about this point because it's consistent with fundamental molecular biology: mRNA is translated in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus, and the flow of genetic information doesn't work in reverse without reverse transcriptase enzymes, which these vaccines don't contain.\n\nWhere I'm less certain is in the precise technical details of the lipid nanoparticle delivery system that protects the mRNA and helps it enter cells, and the specific modifications made to the mRNA (like pseudouridine substitution) to reduce immune reactivity to the mRNA molecule itself. I understand the general purpose of these innovations but wouldn't want to explain the biochemistry at a specialist level without risking inaccuracies.\n\nI should also note that mRNA vaccine technology continues to evolve, and there may be developments after my training cutoff that I'm not aware of."}]}

(France still celebrates this day, like our July 4th.) The people said: we want a say in how the country is run.\n\n2. **New rules.** They wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man — similar to our Bill of Rights. It said everyone had equal rights, not just nobles. They took power away from the king.\n\n3. **Things got extreme.** A group called the Jacobins took control and decided the king was a traitor. King Louis XVI was executed by guillotine in 1793. Then they started executing anyone they considered an \"enemy of the revolution\" — this period is called the **Reign of Terror**. Thousands of people were killed.\n\n4. **It calmed down eventually.** The Terror ended when its leader, Robespierre, was himself executed. Then a military general named Napoleon Bonaparte took over and eventually made himself emperor — which was kind of ironic, since the whole revolution was about getting rid of kings.\n\n**Why it matters:** It showed that regular people could overthrow a monarchy and demand rights.

Ball lightning has been reported for centuries — glowing, spherical objects that appear during thunderstorms, float through the air, and sometimes pass through solid objects before dissipating. The reports are numerous enough that most scientists accept it's a real phenomenon, not just folklore.\n\nHowever, there is no widely accepted scientific explanation for it. Several hypotheses exist. One proposes that ball lightning consists of vaporized silicon from soil struck by lightning, forming a glowing ball of nanoparticles. Another suggests it could be a plasma phenomenon sustained by microwave radiation from the storm. There are also ideas involving combustion of organic material or even quantum effects.\n\nIn 2012, researchers in China accidentally captured what appeared to be ball lightning on spectrographic equipment, and the composition seemed consistent with the vaporized silicon hypothesis. But I want to be careful here — one observation doesn't settle the matter, and I may be slightly misremembering the details of that study.\n\nWhat I'm confident about: ball lightning is real, it's poorly understood, and anyone who tells you the answer is definitively known is overstating the science.

Each can either cooperate (stay silent) or defect (betray the other). The outcomes:\n\n- Both stay silent: Each gets 1 year (mutual cooperation)\n- Both betray: Each gets 5 years (mutual defection)\n- One betrays, one stays silent: Betrayer goes free, silent one gets 10 years\n\n**The dilemma:**\nNo matter what the other person does, betraying is the \"rational\" choice for each individual:\n- If they stay silent → I should betray (I go free instead of 1 year)\n- If they betray → I should betray (5 years instead of 10)\n\nSo both betray, and both get 5 years — even though they'd both be better off staying silent (1 year each). Individual rationality leads to a collectively worse outcome.\n\n**Why it matters beyond prison:**\n\nThis pattern appears everywhere:\n- **Arms races**: Countries would be safer if neither built weapons, but each individually benefits from arming\n- **Climate change**: Every country benefits from polluting while others cut emissions\n- **Price wars**: Companies would profit more with higher prices, but each is tempted to undercut\n- **Open source**: Everyone benefits from contributing, but individuals can free-ride\n\n**The solution — repeated games:**\nWhen the game is played repeatedly (not just once), cooperation becomes rational. The strategy \"tit-for-tat\" (cooperate first, then mirror the other's last move) is remarkably effective. This is why relationships, reputation, and institutions matter — they turn one-shot dilemmas into repeated games where cooperation pays off.\n\nRobert Axelrod's tournaments showed that in repeated interactions, nice strategies (that start with cooperation) consistently outperform selfish ones. Trust builds over time, and the shadow of future interaction makes cooperation rational."}]}

Large models like nemotron:30b-q4 are falling back to CPU and timing out.\n\n**Options:**\n\n1. **Wait for training** (~21 hours remaining) - Then run full evaluation on GPU\n2. **Test small models now** - qwen2.5:1.5b and qwen2.5-coder:7b can run on remaining GPU\n3. **Pause training** - Free GPU, run evaluation, resume training\n\nWhat would you prefer? The training is at step 8/768 (~1% complete) so pausing now would lose minimal progress if you want to see the evaluation results first."}]}

Running a full 5K without walking is a legit milestone, especially if you've been building up to it.

You didn't set a time goal that depends on a dozen variables — you set a process goal that's about your effort and willpower. And you nailed it.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking — what was the experience like? Did you hit a wall at any point and push through it, or did you find a rhythm and hold it? Knowing how the race felt can actually be useful for planning what's next, if you're thinking about continuing.\n\nAnd speaking of what's next: if you're enjoying running and want to keep going, this is a great foundation. You could work on improving your 5K time, or start building toward a 10K. But there's also absolutely nothing wrong with just doing more 5Ks and enjoying the experience. Not everything has to be about the next bigger thing.\n\nWhatever you decide, today you're a person who ran a 5K without stopping. That's yours now. Well done."}]}

Housing bubble** — Easy credit and low interest rates fueled a massive rise in home prices. Lenders gave mortgages to borrowers who couldn't afford them (subprime mortgages), often with adjustable rates that started low but would spike.\n\n**2. Securitization** — Banks bundled these risky mortgages into complex financial products (mortgage-backed securities, CDOs) and sold them to investors worldwide. Rating agencies gave many of these products AAA ratings despite the underlying risk.\n\n**3. Excessive leverage** — Financial institutions borrowed heavily to buy these securities, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Some banks had leverage ratios of 30:1 or higher.\n\n**4. The trigger** — When housing prices stopped rising and subprime borrowers began defaulting, the securities backed by those mortgages lost value rapidly. Because they were spread throughout the global financial system, losses appeared everywhere simultaneously.\n\n**5. Systemic collapse** — Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in September 2008. Credit markets froze — banks stopped lending to each other because nobody knew who held toxic assets. This credit freeze spread to the real economy: businesses couldn't get loans, layoffs accelerated, consumer spending dropped.\n\n**6. Regulatory failure** — Derivatives like credit default swaps were largely unregulated. Shadow banking operated outside traditional oversight. Regulators missed or ignored warning signs.\n\n**Consequences:** Global recession, 8.7 million US jobs lost, millions of foreclosures, $19.2 trillion in household wealth destroyed, and the Dodd-Frank Act reforms.\n\nThe core lesson: when risk is hidden, distributed widely, and amplified by leverage, the resulting failure is catastrophic and systemic rather than contained."}]}

Important caveats:\n\n- CAGR smooths out volatility. The actual growth might have been 100% one year and 10% another.\n- It only considers the start and end points, ignoring what happened in between.\n- A company that went $2M → $10M → $3M → $8M has the same CAGR as one that grew steadily.\n\nFor context, 41.4% annual growth is strong — typical of a successful startup or high-growth tech company.

Think of it like this:\n\nImagine your country has a king who lives in an enormous palace and throws huge parties, while most regular people can barely afford bread. That's France in the 1780s.\n\n**Why it started:**\nFrance was broke from fighting wars (including helping America win independence), and there was a food shortage. Regular people were starving while the king and nobles paid almost no taxes. People got angry — really angry.\n\n**What happened:**\n\n1. **1789 — The revolution begins.** A huge crowd stormed the Bastille, a prison/fortress in Paris, on July 14th. (France still celebrates this day, like our July 4th.) The people said: we want a say in how the country is run.\n\n2. **New rules.** They wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man — similar to our Bill of Rights. It said everyone had equal rights, not just nobles. They took power away from the king.\n\n3. **Things got extreme.** A group called the Jacobins took control and decided the king was a traitor. King Louis XVI was executed by guillotine in 1793. Then they started executing anyone they considered an \"enemy of the revolution\" — this period is called the **Reign of Terror**. Thousands of people were killed.\n\n4. **It calmed down eventually.** The Terror ended when its leader, Robespierre, was himself executed. Then a military general named Napoleon Bonaparte took over and eventually made himself emperor — which was kind of ironic, since the whole revolution was about getting rid of kings.\n\n**Why it matters:** It showed that regular people could overthrow a monarchy and demand rights. The ideas of liberty, equality, and democracy that came from this revolution influenced countries all over the world, including the growth of democracy everywhere."}]}

Each can either cooperate (stay silent) or defect (betray the other). The outcomes:\n\n- Both stay silent: Each gets 1 year (mutual cooperation)\n- Both betray: Each gets 5 years (mutual defection)\n- One betrays, one stays silent: Betrayer goes free, silent one gets 10 years\n\n**The dilemma:**\nNo matter what the other person does, betraying is the \"rational\" choice for each individual:\n- If they stay silent → I should betray (I go free instead of 1 year)\n- If they betray → I should betray (5 years instead of 10)\n\nSo both betray, and both get 5 years — even though they'd both be better off staying silent (1 year each). Individual rationality leads to a collectively worse outcome.\n\n**Why it matters beyond prison:**\n\nThis pattern appears everywhere:\n- **Arms races**: Countries would be safer if neither built weapons, but each individually benefits from arming\n- **Climate change**: Every country benefits from polluting while others cut emissions\n- **Price wars**: Companies would profit more with higher prices, but each is tempted to undercut\n- **Open source**: Everyone benefits from contributing, but individuals can free-ride\n\n**The solution — repeated games:**\nWhen the game is played repeatedly (not just once), cooperation becomes rational. The strategy \"tit-for-tat\" (cooperate first, then mirror the other's last move) is remarkably effective. This is why relationships, reputation, and institutions matter — they turn one-shot dilemmas into repeated games where cooperation pays off.\n\nRobert Axelrod's tournaments showed that in repeated interactions, nice strategies (that start with cooperation) consistently outperform selfish ones. Trust builds over time, and the shadow of future interaction makes cooperation rational."}]}
