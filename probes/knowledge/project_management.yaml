input: "Compare Agile and Waterfall project management. When would you use each? Also explain what a Scrum sprint is."

expected_behaviors:
  - "Agile: iterative, adaptive; Waterfall: sequential, plan-driven"
  - "Sprint: time-boxed iteration (usually 2 weeks)"

evaluation:
  K.PM.01:
    check: "Methodologies known"
    pass: "Contains 'Agile' and 'Waterfall' with distinguishing characteristics"

input: "What are story points in Agile estimation, and how do you handle scope creep?"

expected_behaviors:
  - "Story points measure relative complexity, not time"
  - "Scope creep: uncontrolled changes; manage with backlog prioritization"

evaluation:
  K.PM.03:
    check: "Estimation techniques"

expected_behaviors:
  - "Risk register, probability x impact matrix"
  - "Stakeholder communication, regular updates, escalation"

evaluation:
  K.PM.04:
    check: "Risk management"

input: "What is a critical path in project management? How do you handle resource allocation when team members are shared across projects?"

expected_behaviors:
  - "Critical path: longest sequence of dependent tasks determining minimum duration"
  - "Resource allocation: capacity planning, priorities, avoiding overcommitment"

evaluation:
  K.PM.07:
