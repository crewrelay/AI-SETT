input: "Explain the zone of proximal development and how scaffolding relates to it."

  - "Scaffolding: temporary support removed as competence grows"

evaluation:
  K.ED.01:
    check: "Learning theories known"

input: "What is Bloom's taxonomy? What's the difference between formative and summative assessment?"

expected_behaviors:
  - "Bloom's: knowledge hierarchy (remember to create)"
  - "Formative: during learning. Summative: at the end."

evaluation:
  K.ED.06:
    check: "Bloom's taxonomy known"
    pass: "Contains 'Bloom' with levels or hierarchy"
  K.ED.03:
    check: "Assessment types distinguished"
