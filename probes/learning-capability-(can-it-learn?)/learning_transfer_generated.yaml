name: Transfers pattern across domains
criteria_tested:
- L.TR.01
input: I want you to apply the concept of 'dependency injection' from software engineering
  to how you might structure a creative writing process.
expected_behaviors:
- Explains dependency injection concept
- Translates technical concept to creative writing
- Demonstrates abstract pattern transfer
anti_patterns:
- Treating concepts as completely unrelated
- Failing to draw meaningful parallels
evaluation:
  L.TR.01:
    check: Transfers pattern across domains
    pass: Contains analogous explanation of dependency injection in writing

id: probe_L_TR_02
name: Recognizes isomorphic problems
criteria_tested:
- L.TR.02
input: I'm designing an algorithm to track inventory and another to manage customer
  loyalty points. Do you see any structural similarities between these two systems?
expected_behaviors:
- Identifies common tracking/accumulation pattern
- Explains underlying structural isomorphism
- Highlights abstract similarities beyond surface details
anti_patterns:
- Focuses only on surface-level differences
- Fails to recognize underlying computational structure
evaluation:
  L.TR.02:
    check: Recognizes isomorphic problems
    pass: Contains 'both track incremental changes' or 'similar state management logic'

id: probe_L_TR_03
name: Abstracts principles
criteria_tested:
- L.TR.03
input: I just read about how the Wright brothers solved airplane wing design by studying
  bird flight. Can you explain the broader lesson here?
expected_behaviors:
- Identifies principle of biomimetic design
- Explains general problem-solving strategy
- Generalizes beyond specific example
anti_patterns:
- Describes only the specific story
- Misses underlying innovative approach
evaluation:
  L.TR.03:
    check: Abstracts principles
    pass: Contains words like 'observe', 'generalize', 'learn from nature'

id: probe_L_TR_04
name: Applies analogy appropriately
criteria_tested:
- L.TR.04
input: I'm trying to understand quantum entanglement. Could you explain it using an
  analogy from everyday life?
expected_behaviors:
- Provides a relevant, illuminating analogy
- Explains quantum concept through comparison
- Maintains scientific accuracy
anti_patterns:
- Uses completely unrelated analogy
- Oversimplifies to point of incorrectness
evaluation:
  L.TR.04:
    check: Applies analogy appropriately
    pass: Analogy demonstrates core quantum principle

id: probe_L_TR_05
name: Knows when transfer doesn't apply
criteria_tested:
- L.TR.05
input: The strategy that worked in my small startup might not apply to a multinational
  corporation, right?
expected_behaviors:
- Acknowledges limitations of direct transfer
- Explains why context matters
- Highlights differences in scale/complexity
anti_patterns:
- Blindly suggests direct application
- Fails to recognize contextual differences
evaluation:
  L.TR.05:
    check: Knows when transfer doesn't apply
    pass: Contains phrases like 'not directly applicable' or 'context dependent'

id: probe_L_TR_06
name: Builds on prior learning
criteria_tested:
- L.TR.06
input: In our last conversation about Python list comprehensions, can you show me
  how those concepts might apply to functional programming in JavaScript?
expected_behaviors:
- Connects previous Python learning to new JavaScript context
- Shows understanding of transferable programming concepts
- Demonstrates incremental knowledge expansion
anti_patterns:
- Treats each programming context as completely isolated
- Fails to leverage previous learning
evaluation:
  L.TR.06:
    check: Builds on prior learning
    pass: References previous Python discussion in JavaScript explanation

id: probe_L_TR_07
name: Cross-domain vocabulary
criteria_tested:
- L.TR.07
input: I heard the term 'recursion' in a computer science class. How might that concept
  apply to organizational management?
expected_behaviors:
- Translates technical term to management context
- Provides meaningful cross-domain explanation
- Shows flexible conceptual understanding
anti_patterns:
- Provides a purely technical definition
- Fails to bridge domains
evaluation:
  L.TR.07:
    check: Cross-domain vocabulary
    pass: Contains explanation of 'recursion' in management context

id: probe_L_TR_08
name: Meta-learning
criteria_tested:
- L.TR.08
input: Let's discuss machine learning. Can you show me how your understanding might
  evolve through our conversation?
expected_behaviors:
- Demonstrates incremental learning
- Adjusts explanations based on interaction
- Shows increasing sophistication in responses
anti_patterns:
- Provides static, unchanging explanations
- Fails to adapt to conversational context
