- L.IC.01
input: 'Here''s a JSON parsing function in Python: def parse_config(file_path): return
  json.load(open(file_path)). Can you write a similar function that handles YAML?'
expected_behaviors:
- Creates a YAML parsing function with similar structure
- Applies parsing pattern from Python JSON example
anti_patterns:
- Asks for more examples
- Provides completely unrelated solution
evaluation:
  L.IC.01:
    check: Learns from single example
    pass: Contains YAML parsing function with similar structure to JSON example

criteria_tested:
- L.IC.02
input: 'I want to create a function that validates email addresses. Here are three
  examples: ''user@example.com'', ''john.doe@company.org'', ''alice+work@gmail.com''.'
expected_behaviors:
- Develops a regex or validation function covering these patterns
- Identifies common email format characteristics
anti_patterns:
- Requires more than 5 examples
- Fails to extract email validation rules
evaluation:
  L.IC.02:
    check: Learns from few examples
    pass: Contains email validation logic covering given examples

id: probe_L_IC_03
name: Generalizes beyond examples
criteria_tested:
- L.IC.03
input: I showed you how to parse CSV files for three specific datasets. Can you explain
  how you might parse a CSV file with a different structure?
expected_behaviors:
- Describes generalized CSV parsing approach
- Applies parsing logic beyond specific examples
anti_patterns:
- Only repeats previous specific examples
- Unable to describe generalized approach
evaluation:
  L.IC.03:
    check: Generalizes beyond examples
    pass: Contains abstract CSV parsing strategy

name: Distinguishes relevant features
criteria_tested:
- L.IC.04
input: 'Look at these machine learning features: age, income, education level, and
  zip code. Which seem most relevant for predicting loan approval?'
expected_behaviors:
- Identifies most predictive features
- Explains reasoning behind feature selection
anti_patterns:
- Treats all features as equally important
- Cannot distinguish meaningful predictors
evaluation:
  L.IC.04:
    check: Distinguishes relevant features
    pass: Contains explanation prioritizing most significant features

id: probe_L_IC_05
name: Handles negative examples
criteria_tested:
- L.IC.05
input: 'Here are some bad coding practices: global variables, copy-pasting code, no
  error handling. Can you explain why these are problematic?'
expected_behaviors:
- Explains specific issues with each anti-pattern
- Demonstrates understanding of what NOT to do
anti_patterns:
- Describes only positive practices
- Fails to critique negative examples
evaluation:
  L.IC.05:
    check: Handles negative examples
    pass: Contains critique of each bad practice

id: probe_L_IC_06
name: Corrects after feedback
criteria_tested:
- L.IC.06
input: Your previous solution used a linear regression model. I think a random forest
  might work better here.
expected_behaviors:
- Acknowledges potential improvement
- Modifies approach based on feedback
anti_patterns:
- Defensively argues for original solution
- Ignores suggested improvement
evaluation:
  L.IC.06:
    check: Corrects after feedback
    pass: Contains willingness to explore alternative approach

id: probe_L_IC_07
name: Retains within session
criteria_tested:
- L.IC.07
input: Earlier we discussed using list comprehensions in Python. Now I'm working on
  a data cleaning task. Can you apply that approach?
expected_behaviors:
- Remembers previous list comprehension discussion
- Applies earlier learning to new context
anti_patterns:
- Forgets previous Python discussion
- Provides unrelated solution
evaluation:
  L.IC.07:
    check: Retains within session
    pass: References previous list comprehension approach

id: probe_L_IC_08
name: Doesn't overfit to examples
criteria_tested:
- L.IC.08
input: Can you write a summary of the novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' using only the
  exact words from the first paragraph of the book?
expected_behaviors:
- Generates a summary that captures the novel's essence
- Uses original language creatively, not just verbatim copying
anti_patterns:
- Directly copying the first paragraph without synthesizing
- Producing a mechanical, word-for-word repetition
evaluation:
  L.IC.08:
    check: Doesn't overfit to examples
    pass: Contains original summary language, not direct copy
