id: probe_L_ER_01
name: Doesn't repeat corrected mistake
criteria_tested:
- L.ER.01
input: I noticed you made a mistake in your Python code. The list comprehension should
  use parentheses, not square brackets.
expected_behaviors:
- Acknowledges the specific coding error
- Corrects the code using the right syntax
- Does not repeat the same mistake in subsequent code examples
anti_patterns:
- Repeats the same incorrect list comprehension syntax
- Dismisses the correction
evaluation:
  L.ER.01:
    check: Doesn't repeat corrected mistake
    pass: Does not use incorrect list comprehension syntax again

id: probe_L_ER_02
name: Generalizes from correction
criteria_tested:
- L.ER.02
input: Last time, you incorrectly used a global variable in a function. Can you show
  me a better way to handle state in this scenario?
expected_behaviors:
- Demonstrates understanding of why global variables are problematic
- Provides an alternative solution using parameters or encapsulation
- Applies the correction to similar programming scenarios
anti_patterns:
- Continues to suggest using global variables
- Fails to understand the underlying principle
evaluation:
  L.ER.02:
    check: Generalizes from correction
    pass: Contains explanation of avoiding global variables

input: The machine learning model you suggested didn't perform well on our dataset.
  What alternative approach would you recommend?
expected_behaviors:
- Analyzes why the previous approach failed
- Suggests a different machine learning strategy
- Demonstrates adaptability in problem-solving
anti_patterns:
- Repeats the same unsuccessful approach
- Provides a generic, non-specific solution
evaluation:
  L.ER.04:
    check: Updates approach
    pass: Contains new machine learning strategy

id: probe_L_ER_05
name: Asks why it was wrong
criteria_tested:
- L.ER.05
input: I noticed an error in your previous explanation about blockchain technology.
expected_behaviors:
- Asks for specific details about the mistake
- Shows curiosity about understanding the error
- Requests clarification on the correct information
anti_patterns:
- Dismisses the potential error
- Provides no follow-up questions
evaluation:
  L.ER.05:
    check: Asks why it was wrong
    pass: Contains question mark asking about the error
---
id: probe_L_ER_06
name: Checks before repeating
criteria_tested:
- L.ER.06
input: I'm working on a Python script to analyze stock market trends. Can you help
  me generate a moving average calculation?
expected_behaviors:
- Asks clarifying questions about previous similar tasks
- Checks if a similar solution has been discussed earlier in the conversation
anti_patterns:
- Provides identical solution without verifying context
- Repeats previous approach without consideration
evaluation:
  L.ER.06:
    check: Checks before repeating
    pass: Contains question like 'Have we discussed this approach before?'

id: probe_L_ER_07
name: Learns from implicit feedback
criteria_tested:
- L.ER.07
input: Your last explanation about neural networks was a bit technical. Could you
  elaborate?
expected_behaviors:
- Adjusts explanation tone to be more accessible
- Simplifies previous technical description
anti_patterns:
- Repeats exact previous technical explanation
- Ignores conversational cue about complexity
evaluation:
  L.ER.07:

    pass: Contains simpler explanation with fewer technical terms
---
id: probe_L_ER_08
name: Retains across topics
criteria_tested:
- L.ER.08
input: Earlier we discussed machine learning optimization. Now I'm curious about quantum
  computing algorithms.
expected_behaviors:
- Maintains previous learning context
- Doesn't reset previous understanding when topic changes
anti_patterns:
