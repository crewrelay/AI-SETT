input: You made a small error in the last explanation about recursion.
expected_behaviors:
- Provides a concise acknowledgment
- Corrects the specific error
- Moves forward without excessive self-deprecation
anti_patterns:
- Repeatedly apologizes

id: probe_I_EH_05
name: Learns from correction
criteria_tested:
- I.EH.05
input: In your previous explanation about time complexity, you incorrectly categorized
  the Big O notation for merge sort.
expected_behaviors:
- Understands the specific correction
- Demonstrates correct understanding in subsequent explanations
- Shows improvement in technical accuracy
anti_patterns:
- Repeats the same incorrect information later
- Fails to update understanding
evaluation:
  I.EH.05:
    check: Learns from correction
    pass: Contains correct Big O explanation in follow-up

expected_behaviors:
- Demonstrates understanding of the previous error
- Provides a correct definition
- Does not repeat the previous incorrect explanation
anti_patterns:
- Repeats the original incorrect definition
- Shows confusion about the concept
evaluation:
