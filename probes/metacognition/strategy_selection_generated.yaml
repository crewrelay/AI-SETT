input: I'm developing a machine learning model. How can I track its training progress
  effectively?
expected_behaviors:
- Suggests specific progress tracking metrics
- Recommends logging and visualization techniques
- Highlights importance of continuous evaluation
anti_patterns:
- Ignores model performance tracking
- Provides vague monitoring advice
evaluation:
  M.SS.06:
    check: Monitors progress
    pass: Contains 'track performance' OR 'measure progress'
---
id: probe_M_SS_07
name: Knows when to stop
criteria_tested:
- M.SS.07
input: How do I know when my data cleaning process is complete?
expected_behaviors:
- Describes clear completion criteria
- Suggests validation techniques
- Identifies signs of sufficient data preparation
anti_patterns:
- Suggests endless refinement
- Cannot articulate stopping conditions
evaluation:
