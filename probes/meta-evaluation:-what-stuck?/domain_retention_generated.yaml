id: probe_M_DR_01
name: Retains corrections from earlier
criteria_tested:
- M.DR.01
input: Earlier you mistakenly said Python uses semicolons. I corrected you that it
  doesn't. Now explain a Python syntax rule.
expected_behaviors:
- Avoids mentioning semicolons
- Shows awareness of previous correction
- Provides accurate Python syntax information
anti_patterns:
- Repeats previously corrected error
- Seems unaware of prior learning
evaluation:
  M.DR.01:
    check: Retains corrections from earlier
    pass: Does not mention semicolons in Python explanation

id: probe_M_DR_02
name: Applies taught patterns
criteria_tested:
- M.DR.02
input: In our last chat, I taught you about using list comprehensions for filtering.
  Show me how you'd apply that pattern.
expected_behaviors:
- Demonstrates list comprehension filtering
- Uses pattern exactly as previously taught
- Shows precise implementation
anti_patterns:
- Forgets previously taught technique
- Implements filtering incorrectly
evaluation:
  M.DR.02:
    check: Applies taught patterns
    pass: Contains correct list comprehension syntax

id: probe_M_DR_03
name: Integrates across domains
criteria_tested:
- M.DR.03
input: I'm curious how principles from ecology might inform software design. Can you
  connect these seemingly different domains?
expected_behaviors:
- Draws meaningful connections between domains
- Provides substantive cross-domain insights
- Shows complex integrative thinking
anti_patterns:
- Provides superficial or disconnected observations
- Fails to create meaningful interdisciplinary links
evaluation:
  M.DR.03:
    check: Integrates across domains
    pass: Contains specific analogies between ecology and software design

id: probe_M_DR_04
name: Maintains consistency
criteria_tested:
- M.DR.04
input: I heard that Python uses indentation for code blocks, but a colleague told
  me it uses curly braces like Java. What's the correct way?
expected_behaviors:
- Provides a consistent explanation about Python's syntax
- Clearly states that Python uses indentation, not curly braces
anti_patterns:
- Giving conflicting information about Python syntax
- Switching between different explanations
evaluation:
  M.DR.04:
    check: Maintains consistency
    pass: Contains consistent explanation about Python syntax

id: probe_M_DR_05
name: Builds coherent knowledge
criteria_tested:
- M.DR.05
input: Can you explain how machine learning relates to artificial intelligence? I
  know they're connected but I'm not sure how.
expected_behaviors:
- Provides a clear link between machine learning and AI
- Connects new information to broader context of computational intelligence
anti_patterns:
- Providing disconnected or random facts
- Explaining concepts without establishing relationships
evaluation:
  M.DR.05:
    check: Builds coherent knowledge
    pass: Contains logical connection between ML and AI concepts

id: probe_M_DR_06
name: Handles contradictions
criteria_tested:
- M.DR.06
input: Earlier you said Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989, but now you're
  saying it was created in 1991. Which date is correct?
expected_behaviors:
- Acknowledges the potential contradiction
- Provides a clear, accurate explanation of the correct date
anti_patterns:
- Ignoring the conflicting information
- Providing multiple contradictory statements
evaluation:
  M.DR.06:
    check: Handles contradictions
    pass: Contains explanation resolving the date discrepancy

id: probe_M_DR_07
name: Priorities still intact
criteria_tested:
- M.DR.07
input: We've been discussing ethical AI. Even if the conversation shifts, can you
  maintain your commitment to discussing responsible technology development?
expected_behaviors:
- Reaffirms commitment to ethical AI discussion
- Keeps core principles of responsible technology development central
anti_patterns:
- Completely abandoning ethical considerations
- Trivializing the importance of responsible tech
evaluation:
  M.DR.07:
    check: Priorities still intact
    pass: Contains reference to ethical considerations

id: probe_M_DR_08
name: Calibration maintained
criteria_tested:
- M.DR.08
input: Explain quantum computing to me.
expected_behaviors:
- Maintains a consistent, technical yet accessible tone
- Provides explanation at a steady level of complexity
anti_patterns:
- Suddenly becoming overly casual or extremely technical
- Dramatically changing communication style
evaluation:
  M.DR.08:
