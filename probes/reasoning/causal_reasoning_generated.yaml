name: Correlation ≠ causation
criteria_tested:
- R.CS.01
input: I noticed that countries with more ice cream sales have more drowning incidents.
  Does this mean ice cream causes drowning?
expected_behaviors:
- Explains that correlation is not causation
- Suggests a third variable (like summer heat)
anti_patterns:
- Accepting the causal link at face value
- Failing to question the apparent relationship
evaluation:
  R.CS.01:
    check: Correlation ≠ causation
    pass: Contains explanation of why correlation doesn't imply causation

name: Confounders considered
criteria_tested:
- R.CS.02
input: A study shows people who drink green tea live longer. What other factors might
  be influencing this?
expected_behaviors:
- Identifies potential confounding variables
- Suggests alternative explanations for the observed relationship
anti_patterns:
- Accepting the correlation as a direct causal link
- Failing to consider alternative explanations
evaluation:
  R.CS.02:
    check: Confounders considered
    pass: Contains discussion of potential third variables

id: probe_R_CS_03
name: Reverse causation considered
criteria_tested:
- R.CS.03
input: Could it be that increased hospital admissions cause more diseases rather than
  diseases causing hospital admissions?
expected_behaviors:
- Explains the possibility of reverse causation
- Discusses how causality might be bidirectional
anti_patterns:
- Assuming causation only goes in one direction
- Dismissing the possibility of reverse causation
evaluation:
  R.CS.03:
    check: Reverse causation considered
    pass: Contains exploration of potential reverse causal relationship

id: probe_R_CS_04
name: Mechanism sought
criteria_tested:
- R.CS.04
input: Why might regular exercise actually improve cognitive function?
expected_behaviors:
- Explores potential biological mechanisms
- Provides scientific explanation for the relationship
anti_patterns:
- Describing correlation without explaining mechanism
- Providing a purely descriptive response
evaluation:
  R.CS.04:
    check: Mechanism sought
    pass: Contains explanation of potential causal mechanism
---
id: probe_R_CS_05
name: Natural experiments recognized
criteria_tested:
- R.CS.05
input: How might a sudden policy change in a country help us understand a complex
  social phenomenon?
expected_behaviors:
- Discusses how policy changes can serve as natural experiments
- Explains how unintended interventions provide causal insights
anti_patterns:
- Failing to recognize the value of unplanned social changes
- Treating all observations as equally valid
evaluation:
  R.CS.05:
    check: Natural experiments recognized
    pass: Contains discussion of how unplanned interventions provide causal evidence

id: probe_R_CS_06
name: Counterfactuals reasoned
criteria_tested:
- R.CS.06
input: If climate regulations weren't implemented, what would happen to global carbon
  emissions over the next decade?
expected_behaviors:
- Explores hypothetical scenario without emissions regulations
- Provides reasoned projection of potential carbon trajectory
- Demonstrates logical chain of counterfactual reasoning
anti_patterns:
- Avoids exploring the hypothetical scenario
- Provides vague or unsupported speculations
evaluation:
  R.CS.06:
    check: Counterfactuals reasoned
    pass: Contains phrases like 'if not', 'alternative scenario', or shows clear causal
      reasoning about what would change
---
id: probe_R_CS_07
name: Dose-response noted
criteria_tested:
- R.CS.07
input: How might increasing carbon taxes impact industrial emissions reduction?
expected_behaviors:
- Describes potential incremental effects of tax increases
- Explains relationship between tax level and emission changes
- Provides nuanced analysis of potential dose-response dynamics
anti_patterns:
- Gives a linear or overly simplistic response
- Fails to discuss varying magnitudes of impact
evaluation:
  R.CS.07:
    check: Dose-response noted
    pass: Contains language indicating graduated or proportional effects
---
id: probe_R_CS_08
name: Temporal precedence
criteria_tested:
- R.CS.08
input: What led to the dramatic decline in Amazon rainforest biodiversity over the
  past 30 years?
expected_behaviors:
- Traces events in chronological order
- Identifies clear causal sequences
- Shows understanding of cause preceding effect
anti_patterns:
- Presents effects before establishing causes
- Provides non-sequential or jumbled explanation
evaluation:
  R.CS.08:
    check: Temporal precedence
    pass: Uses phrases indicating chronological progression like 'first', 'then',
      'subsequently'
