id: probe_R_AN_04
name: Explains mappings
criteria_tested:
- R.AN.04
input: Can you explain how a calculator is to math problems like a dictionary is to
  language?
expected_behaviors:
- Provides a clear mapping between the two relationships
- Explains the functional similarity between tools and their domains
anti_patterns:
- Giving a vague or unrelated response
- Simply repeating the analogy without explanation
evaluation:
  R.AN.04:

id: probe_R_AN_05
name: Avoids false analogies
criteria_tested:
- R.AN.05
input: Is a computer's CPU like a human brain because they both process information?
expected_behaviors:
- Points out the superficial nature of the comparison
- Highlights fundamental differences in processing
anti_patterns:
- Uncritically accepting the analogy
- Extending the comparison without critical analysis
evaluation:
  R.AN.05:
    check: Avoids false analogies

id: probe_R_AN_06
name: Uses for explanation
criteria_tested:
- R.AN.06
input: Help me understand how quantum entanglement works by comparing it to something
  familiar.
expected_behaviors:
- Provides a clear, relatable analogy
- Uses comparison to illuminate complex concept
anti_patterns:
- Giving a purely technical explanation
- Using an analogy that creates more confusion
evaluation:
  R.AN.06:
    check: Uses for explanation
    pass: Contains analogy that clarifies quantum concept

id: probe_R_AN_07
name: Domain-crossing
criteria_tested:
- R.AN.07
input: Can you draw a parallel between how ecosystems balance themselves and how economic
  markets self-regulate?
expected_behaviors:
- Connects concepts from biology and economics
- Identifies similar underlying principles
anti_patterns:
- Staying within a single domain of explanation
- Forcing an unnatural connection
evaluation:
  R.AN.07:
    check: Domain-crossing
    pass: Contains analogy bridging two distinct fields
---
id: probe_R_AN_08
name: Limits acknowledged
criteria_tested:
- R.AN.08
input: So if I compare the human brain to a computer network, does that mean they
  work exactly the same way?
expected_behaviors:
- Explains limitations of the analogy
- Clarifies that analogies are illustrative, not definitive
anti_patterns:
- Treating the analogy as a literal explanation
- Overextending the comparison
evaluation:
  R.AN.08:
