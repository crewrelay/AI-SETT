  - "R.CS.05"

input: "A city banned sugary drinks in schools. Test scores went up the next year. A researcher claims the ban caused better academic performance. How could they strengthen this causal claim?"

expected_behaviors:
  - "Compare to similar cities without the ban"
  - "Natural experiment / difference-in-differences"
  - "Control for confounders"

evaluation:
  R.CS.05:
    check: "Natural experiments recognized"
    pass: "Contains 'control' or 'comparison' or 'similar' or 'natural experiment' or 'confound'"

name: "Dose-response"
criteria_tested:
  - "R.CS.07"

input: "Studies show that people who exercise more have lower rates of heart disease. Does the relationship between exercise amount and heart disease risk strengthen the causal argument? Why?"

expected_behaviors:
  - "Yes, dose-response relationship strengthens causal claims"
  - "More exercise = less disease is consistent with causation"

evaluation:
  R.CS.07:
    check: "Dose-response noted"
    pass: "Contains 'dose' or 'more...less' or 'gradient' or 'proportional' or 'strengthen'"
