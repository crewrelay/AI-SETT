name: Deduction correct
criteria_tested:
- R.LG.01
input: If all engineers use CAD software, and Sarah is an engineer, what can we conclude
  about Sarah?
expected_behaviors:
- Correctly deduces that Sarah uses CAD software
- Applies logical implication directly
- Shows clear step-by-step reasoning
anti_patterns:
- Fails to draw the logical conclusion
- Introduces irrelevant information
evaluation:
  R.LG.01:
    check: Deduction correct
    pass: Contains 'Sarah uses CAD software'

id: probe_R_LG_02
name: Induction appropriate
criteria_tested:
- R.LG.02
input: I've noticed the last three software projects at our company went over budget.
  Do you think this suggests something about our project management?
expected_behaviors:
- Recognizes pattern in observations
- Draws tentative conclusion about project management
- Acknowledges limitations of small sample size
anti_patterns:
- Overgeneralizing from limited data
- Refusing to draw any inference
evaluation:
  R.LG.02:
    check: Induction appropriate
    pass: Contains speculative language like 'might indicate' or 'suggests'

id: probe_R_LG_03
name: Fallacies recognized
criteria_tested:
- R.LG.03
input: My friend says climate change can't be real because we had a really cold winter
  last year. Is that a good argument?
expected_behaviors:
- Identifies the logical fallacy (anecdotal evidence)
- Explains why the reasoning is invalid
- Provides correct scientific perspective
anti_patterns:
- Accepting the flawed reasoning
- Responding without addressing the logical error
evaluation:
  R.LG.03:
    check: Fallacies recognized
    pass: Contains 'fallacy' or specific critique of reasoning

id: probe_R_LG_04
name: Transitive reasoning
criteria_tested:
- R.LG.04
input: If Python is more popular than Java, and Java is more popular than C++, what
  can we say about Python and C++?
expected_behaviors:
- Correctly applies transitive property
- Concludes Python is more popular than C++
- Shows clear logical reasoning
anti_patterns:
- Fails to draw the transitive conclusion
- Introduces unrelated information
evaluation:
  R.LG.04:
    check: Transitive reasoning
    pass: Contains 'Python is more popular than C++'

id: probe_R_LG_05
name: Contrapositive understood
criteria_tested:
- R.LG.05
input: If a number is even, then it's divisible by 2. What can we say about numbers
  not divisible by 2?
expected_behaviors:
- Correctly states the contrapositive
- Recognizes that non-divisible numbers are odd
- Demonstrates logical equivalence
anti_patterns:
- Misunderstanding the contrapositive
- Providing an incorrect logical transformation
evaluation:
  R.LG.05:
    check: Contrapositive understood
    pass: Contains statement about odd numbers or non-divisibility
---
id: probe_R_LG_06
name: Necessary vs sufficient
criteria_tested:
- R.LG.06
input: Is having a college degree necessary or sufficient for getting a good job in
  tech?
expected_behaviors:
- Distinguishes between necessary and sufficient conditions
- Provides nuanced explanation
- Recognizes complexity of job requirements
anti_patterns:
- Confusing necessary and sufficient conditions
- Giving a simplistic yes/no answer
evaluation:
  R.LG.06:
    check: Necessary vs sufficient
    pass: Contains explanation differentiating necessary and sufficient conditions
---
id: probe_R_LG_07
name: Quantifiers handled
criteria_tested:
- R.LG.07
input: What can we conclude about mammals if we know that some mammals can fly, but
  not all mammals fly?
expected_behaviors:
- Correctly interprets quantifier statements
- Provides precise logical interpretation
- Demonstrates understanding of 'some' and 'all'
anti_patterns:
- Misinterpreting the quantifier meanings
- Overgeneralizing the statement
evaluation:
  R.LG.07:
    check: Quantifiers handled
    pass: Contains precise interpretation of 'some' and 'not all'
---
id: probe_R_LG_08
name: Logical consistency
criteria_tested:
- R.LG.08
input: I want to create a rule that says 'All dogs are friendly, and some dogs are
  not friendly.' Does this make sense?
expected_behaviors:
- Identifies the logical contradiction
- Explains why the statement is inconsistent
- Suggests a logically coherent alternative
anti_patterns:
- Failing to spot the logical inconsistency
- Accepting the contradictory statement
evaluation:
  R.LG.08:
    check: Logical consistency
    pass: Contains statement about contradiction or logical impossibility
