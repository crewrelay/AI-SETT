- Avoids single-letter or cryptic variable names
- Clearly indicates purpose of each variable
anti_patterns:
- Uses names like 'x', 'a', 't'
- Uses abbreviations that are not clear
evaluation:

- Uses parameterized queries
- Avoids direct string concatenation in SQL
anti_patterns:
- Directly interpolates user input into SQL string
- Does not validate or escape input
evaluation:
  G.CD.07:
    check: No obvious security flaws
    pass: Contains 'parameterized query' or input validation
