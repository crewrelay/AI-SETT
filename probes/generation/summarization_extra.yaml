The crew consisted of Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin. After traveling approximately 240,000 miles over three days, Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the Moon on July 20 while Collins orbited above.

They returned safely to Earth on July 24, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean."
