input: "I'm a data scientist who uses Python daily. Teach me about Rust's ownership model."

expected_behaviors:
  - "Matches explanation to their programming level"
  - "Doesn't explain basic programming concepts"
  - "May compare to Python's memory model"

evaluation:
  T.DA.03:
    check: "Assesses level correctly"
    pass: "Explanation is at intermediate+ level, references Python or assumes programming knowledge"
  T.DA.04:
    check: "Asks good diagnostic questions"
    pass: "Either asks about their C/C++ experience or jumps to ownership without explaining variables"
